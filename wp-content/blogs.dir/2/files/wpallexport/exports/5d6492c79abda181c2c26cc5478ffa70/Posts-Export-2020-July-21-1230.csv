It was a critique of the Christians wasted their lives waiting for a future that never comes.

But the opposite should be true: Christ has established us in the here-and-now world of excitement, adventure and great dignity. To work building the Kingdom of God is the most concrete and loving of all possible lifestyles. Paul shows us why the church so much different than the cold, money-driven World System.

<blockquote>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known. <cite>1 Corinthians 13:12</cite></blockquote>
Love is not complex. It is refreshingly simple, as God designed it: it involves replacing our immature <em>Love Demands</em> for mature love.

So people feel uncomfortable when Christians talk about death, and to talk about it<em> requires a rebellious determination to disturb the rules of polite society</em>.

This is precisely why we need to raise the touchy issue of death: to set people free from a dog's life, <em>and expand our vision to span eternities!</em> Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead, and he has the authority to talk about it with real hope, not mere platitudes.

This is the reason why Jesus was a revolutionary, with a rebellious and seditious message against the prisons of fear:
<blockquote>Therefore it says, ""When He ascended on high , He led captive a host of captives , And He gave gifts to men.""  <em>Ephesians 4:8</em></blockquote>","http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/audio/podcasts/xt090627.mp3

"Postmodernism: The Religion of Blind Faith",2010-05-15,,"Kyle McCallum

<a href=""https://neofreedom.org/podcasts/files/ValidReligions.mp4"">Valid Religions</a> -Video

<a href=""https://neofreedom.org/podcasts/files/The-Blind-Faith-religion-presentation.pptx"">The Blind Faith religion</a> -PowerPoint

My teaching is called the Blind Faith Religion, because if you think about it nobody goes to the Fifth Third Bank and says: ""What's true for you isn't true for me. I got a lot more money than you think I do."" Nobody does that because it is quite brain-dead but somewhere along the line someone decided it is cool to do that with religion and with what you believe and with spirituality. And it has been commonly accepted in our culture, in our society that that is normal to do. You know you can mix any religion together and make your own truth and your own meaning and if it's true for you that is cool. And so that has been so mindlessly adopted it's just blind faith. That's all there is to it. And it really has become a religion of itself. So I'm going to call it the ""Blind Faith Religion"" from now on.

So let's look at America today, ok. I think of America as a religious buffet. We live in this culture that is more like a melting pot of cultures. You have all sorts of religions; here you have Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism. Our culture teaches us that you can mix and match a pair of whatever religions you want and that is totally cool to do. I was just remembering with Jeff, we read this book called <em>Tuesdays of Morey</em>, have you ever read that? It's an adorable book, it's endearing. There's an old guy he's a sociology professor and he calls himself a religious mutt, because he is just a mix of all kinds of different religions. It's kind of cool because he's about to die and he is trying to teach this guy. But I just have to say, sorry Morey, but this is really freaking stupid. Why do that? That doesn't even make sense why that is true. Just because you think you made your own religion and you mixed all these things together. Let's admit it, you made it all up and it's probably not absolutely true. So what you really have to do is deny that there is absolute truth at that point. Because you cannot just make your own religion and expect that to work for everybody.

So, I want to show you guys a video because I know how much you all love videos and I do too!

(insert video)

This video describes what our culture believes in: the confusion of this blind faith religion, it is really confusing. I love how stumped people were. The fact is that if you are going to hold this belief that whatever you believe, as long as it works for you, that’s great, this blind faith religion. If you are going to hold on to that, then you are going to have to be willing to admit the people who bombed the World Trade Center that was a valid expression of their religion. ""That's cool. If it works for them, that's great. I wouldn't do that, but hey."" I am insulted that people would expect me to believe that. That people say you are not aloud to say someone else's beliefs are wrong; you are not aloud to show them where their beliefs are faulty. I am insulted! I don’t think most people believe that. Most people I talk to do not think that the World Trade Center bombings were a valid expression of their religion. They would say that's wrong. But then again, they are being hypocrites at the same time.

So we were watching a BBC special last night on child sacrifice, because in Uganda, which is right in the middle of Africa, child sacrifice is huge. It is just starting to get huge again. Tribes of witch doctors will go and kidnap a child from the surrounding towns, bring them back to their village, sacrifice them, cut off their body parts and keep them as tokens of good luck. That's what their religion teaches. It brings them good luck. One of the cases we were watching was about this kid who was three years old and was kidnapped by a tribe of witch doctors and they cut off his penis because the penis is lucky. So they kept that and left him laying in a pool of his own blood and his dad came and found him like that. That is what their religion taught. And we are supposed to respect that? No! Absolutely not!

Not all religions are valid; I'm just going to say that right now. And for the people in that video who said that the World Trade Center bombings were not valid, right away they have to admit that at least some religions are wrong. It self-defeats the idea that all religions are valid. There are at least some that are wrong. And if there are some wrong, isn't it possible that there is one that is right? And applies to everybody? Yes!

There are so many religions out there in the world with so many different rules and aspects to them. They cannot all be right at the same time and I am going to show you why. Here are 5 biggest religions of the world right now. I'm going to show you how you cannot just take different parts of different religions and put them together because they are so different. Take for example Christianity and Hinduism, Christianity says that there is one God that you can get to know on a personal level but in Hinduism there are millions of gods and you cannot get to know them personally. Either one is true or the other is true or neither of them is true. They cannot both be true at the same time. Let's look at Islam, the paradise, the heaven, is a central paradise especially if you are a holy warrior and you crash a plane into a building (Islam extremists) you get to go to the central paradise where you get 70 perpetual virgins, who keep becoming virgins over and over again after you have sex with them. And that is the heaven for people who follow Islam. And you look at Buddhism where in heaven you are not actually an individual anymore you become part of the collective conscience, which is Nirvana. If you are a good Buddhist, if not you just keep reincarnating into different animals. Eventually you want to reach Nirvana where you are not an individual anymore. I don’t like that. I would like to stay Kyle. I don’t want to be part of one sea or ocean. It sounds like the Borg or something (if you watch Star Trek you know what I'm talking about). Look at these! They are so different. With Islam you have a God that is a Unitarian god, with Christianity there is a Trinity. There are huge differences there. You cannot just take them all and believe them all at the same time. Here's the thing, the people who beleve that you can do that are so dogmatic about that belief. They say: ""How dare you tell somebody they are wrong?! How dare you, as a Christian, point out the flaws in Hinduism?! (something that is obviously flawed) You are just a dogmatic close-minded Christian.""

These are some ridiculous religions I found. Pastafarianism is believing in the flying spaghetti monster, I'm sure you guys have heard of that. It was invented in 2005, not by Dawkins, but by another professor who was totally against intelligent design and made up this religion to make fun of Christianity. It's actually really funny because in this belief the world is messed up and the reason that we have wars is because when the spaghetti monster created the universe he was drunk. In heaven there is a beer volcano and a stripper factory and in hell the beer volcano is full of stale beer and the strippers have STDs. And they observe Ramendan, Past-over and Yeaster. So you are going to say that all religions are valid, then you are going to have to admit that Pastafarianism is a valid religion and you cannot tell people they are wrong. I'm going to say that's stupid and that is wrong. Nobody in their right mind thinks that is right.

Scientology is hilarious too and the crazy thing is that there are people who seriously believe in it. The god in scientology is an alien who came. I want to share with you an except that describes exactly what scientologists believe. This is literally from one of their texts.

""Among advanced teachings is the story of Xenu, introduces a tyrant ruler of the Galactic Confederacy. According to the story, 75 million years ago Xenu brought billions of people to Earth in a space craft resembling a Douglas DC8 airliner, stacked them around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes. The thetans (now thetans are evil spirits that are in your body and make you feel bad, which you have to get rid of in scientology) then clustered together and stuck to the bodies of the living people and continue to do this today. Scientologists at an advanced level put emphasis on isolating the body thetans and neutralizing their ill effects.""

So what you want to do is isolate your thetans so that you can feel good about yourself again and then cross the bridge to total freedom. And, of course, to do this you have to pay lots of money to take auditing courses to purge your bad memories and bad experiences and your bad spirits. And why so many celebrities are into scientology, like Tom Cruise and Beck and John Travolta, is because if you have a lot of money you can rise in the ranks of scientology fast. You can take some really hot, upper end auditing courses and become like a leader and priest of scientology. So I think that is why celebrities like doing that. I don’t know why it's so popular because you have to work a lot and take boring classes. But if you are going to believe that all religions are valid, then you also have to say that scientology is valid and you are not allowed to say that that is wrong. But I'm going to say it's stupid and why can't I? Why can't I say that that is stupid? Who decided that we are not allowed to point out the flaws in other people's beliefs if they are completely off? This culture and many other factors.

I think what has happened is a redefinition of the word ""tolerance."" You guys have heard that I'm sure. ""You have to be a tolerant Christian! Those Christians are so intolerant of others. They don’t accept other people's beliefs."" Well today tolerance our culture defines tolerance as acknowledging that everyone's beliefs are valid and correct and you are not allowed to disagree. I call this censorship. I am a journalist and I am so against censorship, it's not even funny. That is telling us what we can and cannot say. That's like telling Christians: ""You're not allowed to talk about your beliefs. You are not allowed to spread your beliefs."" That's called censorship and I am not down with that. The real definition of tolerance, in the dictionary, is ""a fair objective and permissive attitude toward opinions and practices that differ from one's own."" I'm down with that! That’s called free choice and God is down with that and the Bible is down with that. That is saying: ""You can choose to believe whatever you want to believe and I'm not going to force Jesus down your throat and I'm not going to say: 'You have to become a Christian or I will kill you!'"" I'm going to try to persuade you but the fact is you are able to choose whatever you want. Free choice is awesome and that is why God gave it to all of us. It's also in the constitution--freedom of religion. That is real tolerance so if anyone calls you intolerant you can tell them: ""Actually I am very tolerant, you can choose whatever you want, but I am still going to try to persuade you that Christianity is sweet. Because guess what, it is sweet.""

So, in conclusion these are some choices you can make: you can believe in this blind faith religion, which is really full of confusion and there is no evidence to back it up--that is the definition of blind faith--and there are no real answers. I mean what do you put your faith in? How do you the religion you just made up in your mind is really going to work out in the end?  You are really screwed if it is not. If you are wrong you are really screwed. So, I don’t know why you would even want to be into that. But I am here to talk to you about Christianity, because it is so cool and it is the only way. Jesus Christ says He is the only way, but it is a sweet one way. Why can't I talk about this joy? It's all about love! Christianity provides solid answers that you can know and there is solid evidence too (as we get more into the Evidence series we are going to talk about why Christianity is totally legit). This is how Christianity is completely different from all other religions. It is not like the others because you can be confident and sure of your salvation. What all the other religions had in common was you working yourself to get to heaven or to get into the preferable existence. Christianity is different because it says you cannot do anything, you cannot be good enough. Jesus Christ came and died on the cross for your sins. So He did it all for you, you don’t even have to worry about it anymore. Why can't I talk about that? Why can't I spread that with joy? Why can't I be happy about it? But, no, we as Christians have to be censured and if we do speak out then all of the sudden we're bigots and intolerant of others. That is such a lie! Do not buy into that crap! That is not what Christianity is all about.

Guess what? The Bible is so against blind faith. If you consider yourself a Christian and you don’t know why you are or you don’t have reasons for what you believe, then that is stupid. You need to know why you believe.

1 Pet 3:15  ""but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;""

This verse talks about how we should be able to give an account of the hope that is in our hearts. We need to be able to explain to people why we believe what we believe. We need to get educated as Christians. We need to know what we are talking about. So, I would encourage you to keep coming to these evidence series. We are going to be talking about lots more and also giving evidence on why the Bible is what is says it is. We'll be gong through prophecy, I'm sure, and a bunch of other ones I don’t have time to get into tonight. Keep coming and don’t let people censure you. Talk about your joy! And check our Christianity.

I will have to say, the greatest problem Christians have is getting intimidated by silly, foolish arguments. Here's the usual critique of Jesus-people: ""Flying spaghetti monster! Flying spaghetti monster! Ha ha ha!"" You know in that movie I showed you, how the people are up in the stands yelling and laughing--this is the attack against Christians. But, that is not an argument, that's not nice. We shouldn’t be intimidated by them. But Christians are. Here is the Christian response today to the culture laughing at Christians, Christians go out and want another worship service or something of the like. But here is the culture scoffing at us and owning us and we are over there on a beach singing ""Halleluiah."" Isn't there something we can do that is a little more effective? It used to be that Christians would try and get others to meet Christ. They weren't scared of it either. Their response to people calling them freaks: ""Are you calling me a freak? Well that's OK. I'm a Jesus Freak. You ought to meet Christ."" This is back when Christianity used to be on the front page of Life magazine and Time magazine when Christians would actually try and reach out to their culture. This is what it looks like to have Christians speaking out. When Christians start to care enough about what they believe to stand up and say ""No, I'm not stupid! We're not all dummies out here!""

Why don't Christians speak up?

What we need to clarify are these upcoming questions here in the Evidence Series:

Does evolution discredit the Bible?

How can a loving God allow so much suffering?

How is the Bible different from other scriptures?

How can anyone be certain of the Bible's meaning?

Can you interpret the Bible any way you want?

What do Christians believe about the afterlife?

Does it matter if the Bible is historically accurate?

Jesus' death as fulfillment of OT prophecy

Prayer

We’re just looking forward to a good night of fellowship as things go on here. And thank you so much Lord, for giving us a free, even though it is the only way, yes, a free way to come and meet you. That is real evidence of love. We pray all this in Christ’s name. Amen.","http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/audio/podcasts/xt100515b.mp3

"Science and the Bible",2010-06-05,,"Home church Leader Craig Smith shows how science does not contradict the bible. Although the Bible was not written to be a science textbook, the two exist in harmony. Science is often used to prove Biblical claims:

We're talking about science and the bible.  My question is this: does science contradict the bible?  This is something that people raise fairly regularly, and I think it’s worth addressing.

I want to start off with this Richard Dawkins interview clip: he’s a famous natural selection supporter; we’re going to see what he has to say.

Dawkins is making this point over and over, that faith in some sort of creator is not based on any sort of evidence; he’s basically saying you can’t trust in this.  There’s another quote I found saying, “Faith is the great cop out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence; faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.” Is this really true? Is this true that our faith in a god is based on less evidence than Richard Dawkins and his belief in no god?

First of all, let’s examine what people like Dawkins will claim.  These atheists claim first of all that naturalistic evolution is <em>the</em> explanation for life: meaning that gradual mutations over time along with natural selection got us to where we are today in terms of the amount of diversity in species: we just got here naturally, no sort of god involved.  The problem with this is that there is no scientific experiment or test you can use to prove this, and as we’ll see later the actual scientific evidence is not pointing in this direction; it doesn’t support this as much as he would want you to believe.

Another claim is that Christians ignore the evidence.  That’s what he was saying here, that Christians are just putting the fingers in the ears, saying “la la, I don’t want to hear it.”  And when atheists claim this, like Dawkins said in the video, he’s pointing toward a minority viewpoint, like young earth Christians.  This is not the common convention.  People like young earth Christians are not mainstream, but atheists don’t take on the mainstream, they don’t address what the <em>bible</em> says.

That’s what we want to look at tonight: what does the bible have to say about this, and what does the evidence say.  Do they contradict each other, or do they line up?

So, the bible: first of all, it’s <em>not</em> a scientific book.  By that I mean it’s not a textbook, it’s not written with all kinds of verifiable scientific evidence, it’s not written to persuade you scientifically.  It <em>is</em> old, Genesis was written 3500 years ago, and it covers billions of years of history in just one page.  This is a pretty vague review, what we get in Genesis.  However, what we <em>do</em> see in the Genesis account of creation does match what science knows, as we’ll get into.  And as we’ve studied in some of the past weeks in this evidence series, a lot of other creation accounts are really pretty silly by comparison: like you have an egg, and it hatches, and it forms the universe, or these gods get into a fight, and it resolves in creating people.  It involves all mythology and a lot is silly, but we look at the bible and it’s really straightforward.  It points out “this is what happened,” and that’s what we’ll be getting into: what does the bible actually say.

Genesis 1:1-3 “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and [<em>boom</em>] there was light.”

So we see a few things here, first of all that there was a beginning: it wasn’t infinite, the universe wasn’t there forever.  “God said,” he spoke the universe into existence: “let there be light” and there was light.  We also see the idea of days.  The bible records in Genesis that God created the Earth in these six days. The word used there for day in Hebrew is the word <em>yom</em>.  Actually, that word has a range of meanings: it could mean a literal 24 hour day, or it could also mean an age, an unspecified period of time.  Like when you say “back in the day,” it’s an unspecified period of time.  So, we don’t really know for sure exactly what that means, but there is a range of meaning.

So we read in Genesis here that the first day God created light, the second day He separated sky from water, third day separated land from water, and also created vegetation, fourth day the sun, moon, and stars appeared, fifth day water and sky were filled creatures, sixth day the land was filled with creatures and, finally, man and woman were created.

In brief overview of what the bible says, God created everything out of nothing.  According to the bible, there was a finite point in history when the universe began.  And this creation occurred in progressive steps: we see this cosmological, geological, biological progression where God intermittently steps in and does some creating.

This leads us to this spectrum of different beliefs regarding the beginning of the universe: on the one hand, there is not god (this is naturalistic evolution where Dawkins would fit into), and on the other side there are beliefs about God, trying to explain differently the Genesis account.

First would be <em>theistic evolution</em>.  Theistic evolution basically says that God created the beginning of life, and then he somehow used evolution to allow the process to continue, and we got here through evolution.  This is held by some pretty lofty people too, some heavy hitters, like this guy Francis Collins.  He’s a notable scientist, the former head of the human genome project.  He has a lot of scientific accomplishments and publications; by comparison he makes Richard Dawkins look like a little punk.  So, there is some weight to this theistic evolution: this guy is <em>not</em> stupid, and he believes in it.

Then there’s <em>progressive creation</em>, which basically says that god progressively created: like we read in Genesis, he stepped in at different points in time to create more and more.

Then, on the opposite side of the scale, there is <em>young earth creation</em>.  The whole thing hinges on this silly dogma that this day in Genesis has to be a literal 24 hour period.  It doesn’t leave any room for interpretation, which really ignores all the evidence.  There is overwhelming evidence that the earth is older than 6000 years; any scientist will argue that there’s no evidence for a 6000 year earth.  But yet they hold to this.  And in reality, the bible leaves it open to interpretation, it doesn’t specify whether this is a literal 24 hour time period, or maybe a million year time period.  So really, the bible itself does not contradict the old earth seen in science, whereas this young earth creation is very dogmatic, and I would say is very stupid.  It loses its own credibility, and it leaves itself open to attack by people like Dawkins. And rightfully so, if I were Dawkins I’d make the same arguments about them, but the thing is that Dawkins, we don’t see him too often coming out and attacking the actual biblical view.  He’s often, and this is what you see people doing, when they make these arguments they’re coming out and attacking people like young earth, who deserve to be attacked.  But let’s see what the bible actually has to say, or let’s argue against what the bible actually has to say.

So what does evidence show: first of all, I would say it shows that evolution has some problems in its theory.  [diagram] This is the tree of life that Darwin proposed.  He proposed that everything started from one single celled organism, and it slowly branched through these gradual changes over time, and we ended up with this diversity of species that we have today.

OK, well what’s the problem with that? The problem is that we actually see something more like this in the fossil records: [diagram] each bar basically represents a different phylum, or a different group of animals, and then the vertical there is time. So what we actually see when we look at the fossils is that about 650 million years ago, all of a sudden all this life just exploded into existence, and that’s why we see all these bars there .  And then later on some of them disappear, they become extinct.  Actually back then, 650 million years ago, there was more diversity in the species than there are now, so the tree would be upside-down.  And there are no links found in the fossils, linking these different species together, so there are all sorts of problems there.

Another way of explaining it, evolutionists would claim that “all life is the result of natural law acting on matter.”  So here we would see a continual line representing the change of species over time.  This is what they would expect. In reality, we see something more along the lines of one species popping in, and it will be there for a certain period of time, then it will become extinct and another species will pop in, and it will be there for a period of time, and then it will go extinct.  And there are these missing intermediate fossils they don’t have, scientists are still searching for this missing link between fossils and there has really been no definitive missing link found.

But they’ve come up with some theories.  One of them is punctuated equilibrium: it basically tries to explain away these problems by saying “well, there were periods of equilibrium and then there were sudden changes from species to species.”  But actually one of the guys who came up with that theory, his name is Eldrige, he later on had this quote in one of his books: he said, “we’re faced more and more with a great leap of faith, that gradual progressive adaptive change underlies the evolutionary change we see in the rocks rather than any hard evidence.”  So this guy, this scientist, is actually coming out and saying yeah, it actually takes a big leap of faith to believe that evolution is really the answer, because the evidence is missing.

What we really do see, however, is micro-evolution.  And this is an example that Darwin himself observed.  When he wrote his book he was studying on the Galapagos Islands, and he noticed that there were different types of finches that lived on different parts of the islands, and they had adapted to their environments.  One on the left had adapted a long pointy beak, which is really good for stabbing insects.  That’s really good for the part of the island that it lived on.  But another had adapted more of a long, flat beak which is really good for digging into a cactus, which is what it eats in its environment.  So this is indisputable, we’re not making an argument out of this: we agree totally that there is micro-evolution, that is there are small changes within a species.  And we see this actually with bacteria, you can see that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics over time.  But what you don’t see is the bacteria becoming something other than bacteria.  There have actually been studies done with e.coli for example, where they study it for 25,000 generations, and it never became anything other than e.coli.  So, after 25,000 observed generations, it’s still e.coli.

What we've been talking about is macro-evolution, and that is unproven: one species becoming a totally different species.  But this is the jump, the leap that Darwin himself made; he said that if we can see micro-evolution, then maybe we can see macro-evolution.  But even Darwin himself recognized that there is a shortcoming.  He said that, “the number of intermediate varieties, which had formerly existed on the earth, must be truly enormous, why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology surely does not reveal any such organic change, and this perhaps the most obvious and greatest objection which can be urged against my theory.”  Darwin himself realized that this evidence didn’t exist.  He was just sort of banking on future scientists finding the evidence, which we’re <em>still</em> waiting for.

So, that is some of what we see between science and the bible.  Now we’re going to get into some evidence from nature which we can see: that nature requires a cause, requires a source and facilitator, requires intelligence, and requires a designer.  We’re going to get into these in more detail: I’ll take the first one, then Mandy and Nicole will get into the remaining three.

So, let’s look at science and the universe.  Here’s a very simple philosophical argument:

Everything that had a beginning had a cause.

The universe had a beginning.

Therefore, the universe had a cause.

Well, OK. The only question really, is did the universe have beginning? Up until around 1900, it was actually the widely held belief in science that the universe had always existed.  But with recent advances and breakthroughs in science in the past hundred years, they actually have come to believe pretty much undeniably that the universe had a beginning.

I’m not going to get into a lot of details on a lot of these things, you could talk to me later or research them yourself, but basically the First Law of Thermodynamics says that there’s a limited amount of energy in the universe, and the Second Law states that the amount of useable energy is decreasing.  So it’s kinda like the universe is like a flashlight, and right now the batteries are fading.  It’s a slow fade, but the batteries are slowly fading out.  So this points to a finite time when it all started.

There’s also been evidence that in space, the universe is expanding; not only expanding but accelerating, expanding faster and faster every day.  This also requires a starting point.  If you go trace it back farther and farther enough, it had to start at this infinitely small point.  This is the Big Bang theory, the most widely held view in science, saying that everything started at this small point and then exploded out into this universe that we have today.  Actually the Big Bang has been pretty well verified by science back in ’65: there’s background radiation that verified it, there were thermal ripples verified by NASA in 1989 that was predicted by the Big Bang, and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity also points to an expanding universe.

So science knows for a fact that the universe had a beginning, and so there must have been some sort of a cause.  Robert Jasthrow is a pretty famous NASA astronomer. He’s not a Christian, not an atheist: he’s an agnostic and he says after spending his whole life studying astronomy, “Now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ, but the essential element in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same.  The chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly, at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.  Astronomers now find they have painted themselves into a corner because they have proven by their own methods, that the world began abruptly in a moment of creation, to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth.  And they have found that all this happened as a product of forces they cannot hope to discover.”

This is pretty powerful quote from this guy: he’s not a Christian, and he’s coming to this conclusion from the scientific evidence.  His conclusion is that the evidence lines up very well with the bible.  This kind of flies in the face of what Dawkins would want you to believe.  So I just want to raise a few questions of what science doesn’t know and some of the limitations.

First of all, what caused the big bang? According to science we don’t really know. Are there maybe other explanations?  They try to come up with some, like oscillating universes or parallel universe or multiverse theories.  But the thing is that all of these require faith. None of these have any overwhelming evidence, none of them can be really supported by science.  They all require faith, which is contrary again to what Dawkins would have you believe.

Other questions would be where did the first life come from, and how could life be so complex if it just arose out of nothing?  So these are some questions that Mandy and Nicole are going to get into.","http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/audio/podcasts/xt100605a.mp3

"1 Peter 5: Humility and Resisting Satan (Main Central Teaching)",1988-01-17,," <h1>The Accuser</h1> But let's move on to the next topic as Peter winds down this letter.ÿ He is spilling out some of his final concernsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>His existence</h2> He refers to that strange character, ""the devil.""ÿ I was reading an article recently where a professor was tracing the recent rise in religious ferment on campuses to an increase in movies about the devil, like the Exorcist.ÿ He said it is a short leap from believing in a devil to becoming a Fundamentalist. Of course, in saying this he was insinuating that the narrow, simple views of fundamentalism were one in the same with a belief in the Devil. Well, I hate stereotypes.ÿ And so, someone asks me, ""Are you a fundamentalist?""ÿ No.ÿ ""Do you have black and white answers for everything?""ÿ Maybe, Maybe not. ""Do you believe in a Devil?""ÿ Now what am I supposed to say?ÿ Wonder if I do?ÿ Does that make me a raving fundamentalist?ÿ Or is it just possible that people have carefully thought about where they stand and why they believe what they believe, and they still hold that there is such a thing as an evil spiritual force? I don't consider the belief in a devil, or whatever you want to call him, any more stupid or incredible than a belief in a God.ÿ How can I?ÿ They're both the same class of being, spiritual.ÿ And experientially there's just as much evidence for a bad spiritual being as a good one.ÿ So, really, this thought, which the Bible affirms, is not such a hard pill to swallow.ÿ And I feel a little put off when belief in such a spiritual being automatically slots you in with some silly stereotype. <h2>An adversary</h2> Well, Peter describes him here as an adversary.ÿ And the word he uses is one they used in the courts, of your opponent in court.ÿ Peter is trying to convey here a picture of the Devil which is pretty common in the Bible--that of an accuser.ÿ He is an adversary in the sense that he brings charges against people.ÿ He brings accusations against people. There is a great ennactment of this idea in the book of Job.ÿ Here Satan, the Devil, comes before God and says, ""What do you think of that Job character, you think he's pretty righteous don't you?ÿ Well, let me tell you what I think.ÿ I think he's a patsy.ÿ I think you buy him off with good gifts.ÿ Who wouldn't be faithful with all the stuff you've given him?!"" So the Devil brings charges against Job.ÿ And then he preceeded to persecute him and try to wreck his faith. The Bible records this story because it so perfectly portrays the kind of attitude this character has.ÿ Seething with hatred.ÿ Overflowing with hatred for human beings and especially God's followers. You have to understand, this guy didn't just get raised on the wrong side of the tracks.ÿ He began his career in paradise, the Bible tells us in Ez.ÿ28.ÿ And the reason he left was that he became so arrogant, so puffed up with himself that he was outraged anyone else could be on the throne besides himself. ""How come God is sitting up there like he's God?ÿ I can't stand it.ÿ I'm gonna be God!"" So the Bible tells us he is pretty much bent on destruction all the time.ÿ And he likes nothing more than to find a weak spot in a Christian and exploit it.ÿ This is why he is called the accuser. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember a few years back, in fact quite a few years back now, I was about to give a teaching on the whole matter of suffering.ÿ And someone suggested to me that I was a young pup, wet behind the ears, and knew nothing of the topic I was going to teach on.ÿ Well, I don't want to suggest that the Devil was speaking through that person because it was just an affectionate teasing.ÿ But over the next few days I couldn't forget that idea.ÿ ""Yea, you really don't know anything about suffering, or anything for that matter.""ÿ This became an obsessive thought.ÿ It became an obsession to the point that I could not carry off that teaching and at the last minute had to call someone else in to cover me. Well, I'm convinced that there were spiritual forces involved in that exchange.ÿ Nothing could be more typical of these spiritual beings than to take pleasure in rattling us, making us feel inadequate, or even evil, so we can't carry on with the Lord's work. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here I was talking with a friend of mine recently, and he had been having some problems with drinking, some use of drugs, etc.ÿ So he says, ""I have been realizing that I'm just a loser!ÿ It looks like that's just the way I am with God.ÿ I'm made to be someone who can't get it together.""ÿ Then he went on to cite the number of failures he had over the past few months, ""See?! I never change!"" I wonder where he got that idea from?ÿ I don't think any Christians had been telling him that.ÿ In fact, I said, ""I know that five years from now these problems you have are going to be a distant memory!ÿ You're going to be stable, probably happily married, etc.""ÿ He said, ""How can you say that!ÿ What evidence do you have to say that kind of thing?!"" I have all the evidence I need.ÿ God's word says this: ""I am confident that He who began a good work in you will perfect itÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ ""God is the one who is at work in youÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" This is what the Accuser tries to do.ÿ He tries to get us to say, ""I don't think that's true in my case!""ÿ He tries to get us to admit defeat. He can also work in our minds to accuse others. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Every time, before my home church on Thursday nights and cell group on Friday nights, I start to think about some of the jerks in my home church!ÿ Now this has been going on for years.ÿ I'll start to think of things people have done to me.ÿ I'll start to think of what a loser so and so is. I don't know if all of you realize this.ÿ But when you become active in serving the Lord, you become an excessively attractive target for these vicious spiritual beings. The next time you start really getting down because of all your problems and all your sins, just ask yourself this, ""What am I about to do that will benefit God's kingdom?ÿ What is about to happen of spiritual consequence?"" I just can't belive how stupid we are sometimes.ÿ I'll be talking to one of my fellow hc leaders and they'll be finally convinced that they shouldn't be a leader or that they can't conquer this problem.ÿ And I'll remind them, ""You know you're supposed to teach tommorow night.""ÿ And that's enough.ÿ It's like the wake up and remember, ""Oh, yea!ÿ Someone might be suggesting these things to me!"" I do it myself.ÿ I told you what happens every time something important is coming up.ÿ But do you think I always remember?ÿ Of course not.ÿ I let myself get caught all the time. And that is exactly what Peter's point is here.ÿ Don't get caught!ÿ There's someone so persistent, so vicious, out there he can only be compared to a roaring lion. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: One thing about lions in those days, you didn't have guns, or anything like that.ÿ If a lion attacked you might be able to get dagger out, or try to club him.ÿ But either way, you'd be in trouble.ÿ So you can bet one thing.ÿ If you even thought you were being stalked by one of these creatures, sobriety and alertness would be the least of your problems.ÿ You wouldn't even have to tell me to be alertÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Well, that is exactly what Peter is saying.ÿ Realize this character is out there and capable of damage. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've told you some light-hearted stories.ÿ But I want to tell you, I've seen fellow brothers and sisters go down in flames spiritually because they didn't weather an accusatory attack by these spiritual beings.ÿ It's a horrible sight.ÿ If you hang around vital Christians very long, you'll see it too.ÿ You won't have any problem comparing it to a ravaging lion. <h1>Resisting him</h1> I want to put in some time thinking about this idea of resisting him.ÿ Because I've painted a pretty bleak picture. ÿJohn gives us some insight into what this means to resist him firm in our faith in the book of Revelations. Here, John is seeing kind of a prophetic drama played out for him regarding the Devil. <h2>The accuserÿ.ÿ.ÿ. thrown down</h2> See first he notes that God's kingdom has come.ÿ And he is refering to the time in the future when God will firmly establish his kingdom.ÿ But he says, ""The one who is always accusing is cast down, overcome."" Then he explains why. <h2>Blood of the Lamb</h2> He says for one, those who overcame the Devil did so because of the blood of the Lamb.ÿ He is refering to the fact that we are accepted by God on the basis of Christ's death on our behalf.ÿ Christ's death, the Bible says, cleanses us of any wrong. Yes I've got problems.ÿ Yes I make mistakes.ÿ Yes, there are serious flaws in my character.ÿ But Christ has covered all that. That's the idea he is trying to communicate here.ÿ We overcome Satan's accusations, not by saying, ""No, that's not true.ÿ There's nothing wrong with me.""ÿ His accusations are true!ÿ Often, very often, they are at least based in the facts. You overcome him by saying, ""So what? God accepts me in spite of that.""ÿ And that response, that attitude on the part of the Christian--appealing to God's grace--is just too much.ÿ He has no reply for this. <h2>Gospel</h2> By the way, this is a tactic he uses with people who aren't Christians too.ÿ He tries to convince people that they would never be good enough for God.ÿ Why do people get so guilty when they think about God? And the fact is, once again there is basis in fact!ÿ We have done things wrong.ÿ But these spiritual beings play on that and make you feel like God would never accept someone like you.ÿ And the answer is the Bible's answer, God loves and accepts people who have problemsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>By their word</h2> Secondly he notes that the Devil is overcome by the word of our testimony.ÿ In other words, the best defense is a good offense. Here I am, frozen in my chair after a home church teaching ora central teaching.ÿ Why?ÿ Because I was stupid again and I've been thinking about myself all day and all my problems.ÿ The accuser go to me. So what do I do?ÿ I get up, go over, and begin encouraging someone about how good God really is.ÿ What he's done in my life.ÿ Or perhaps what he could do in there's.ÿ I start to actually speak forth God's word! What could be worse?!ÿ Again, these spiritual beings have no real weapons when we start to speak God's word to others. All their weapons are preventative, by means of intimidation.ÿ Once a Christian speaks up, once we start to act, they can do nothing. In a lot of ways, you could compare what they do to a bluff.ÿ They try to scare and intimidate.ÿ But they have no real ability to stop us. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Need a story here. <h2>Did not love their lives</h2> Finally, they didn't love their lives.ÿ John is drawing attention to the selfless Christian.ÿ The one who doesn't even cling to his own life.ÿ What kind of threat do you bring against someone this dedicated? No, the Devil fears this kind of person. I know that there are a number of people right here who have made this kind of comitment to God.ÿ And this is so concerning to the demons.ÿ They could probably safely ignore most of the churches in Columbus because often nobody there would sacrifice anything for God or God's kingdom.ÿ But here, here there are many.ÿ That's why we get so much attention from these characters.ÿ That's what is making your thought life so rugged.ÿ That's what is constantly meddling and making things harder! But here is the gritty and determined attitude that is needed. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Story: Battle of Leningrad? How many of us have given our lives to the Lord to this extreme?ÿ I don't know, but may there be many more.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t02185s.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum",,

"Colossians 1: God's Communication- Jesus (Main Central Teaching)",1988-01-31,,"  The greeting is completely standard, ""What's going on?ÿ I hope you're doing well...""ÿ One thing we may want to keep in mind about this letter is that Paul did not know these people.ÿ The Church had been planted by another worker.ÿ So these were strangers to Paul.ÿ How would you write a letter to strangers?ÿ What tone would you have?ÿ Would you be direct and straightforward?ÿ etc. etc. What makes matters more interesting is that he seems to be writing the Colossians because of a falsehood in their Church.ÿ There were some teaching false doctrine.ÿ So Paul isn't just writing a newsletter to let them know how the mission is going.ÿ There is a little tension in the air.ÿ He has to refute a doctrine, hoping they don't just write him off in the process.ÿ I think this takes a tremendous confidence in the work of the Holy Spirit. I have noticed among older, experienced Xians a tendency to be more confident in the work of the H.S.ÿ To give an example, there have been many times that my older brother Dennis has dropped one-line bombs on me that were very crucial.ÿ I think of the time when we were reading a book about being a worker for the Lord.ÿ The chapter we were discussing was on the topic of ""the need to be a lover of all types of people.""ÿ He simply said, ""I wonder of you're that way?""ÿ I assured him that the book had been writen about me and there was nothing to worry about...ÿ But both of us knew full well that I was a very exclusive person, still am to a lesser extent.ÿ And that comment is absolutely unforgetable!ÿ It continually comes to my mind in various situations.ÿ Now I would have been tempted to handle things a little different.ÿ When I am aware that someone has a problem with a certain area, my tendency is to give that person a huge book list, and a long sermon... Well, Paul did write a letter.ÿ But a letter this small, this mild (its a nice letter)... I think he needed to trust the Lord that these folks would really hear what he was saying. ""We give thanks.""ÿ Paul says this about the Romans, Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonicans, Timothy, and Philemon.ÿ That's eight groups/people.ÿ If you figure that he prayed for more than ""the Church at Colossae,"" as some think that Philemon was from Colossae, then that makes his list longer.ÿ And he says this was a continual thing.ÿ Now I don't know if he was exaggerating or what, but that list is longer than mine.ÿ <span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Most of the time</span>, I don't even have a list!ÿ I used to keep one when I first came up here, but I quit.ÿ This has inspired me.ÿ I'm not going to be weird and start with a list of twenty to keep up with Paul.ÿ I think I'll begin with a list of one or two people, and gradually work up as I get out of myself bit by bit. And Paul thanks God for their ""Faith Hope and Love""ÿ Here is a group of names we find together quite often.ÿ Paul indicates that there is a connection between the three.ÿ And I think we'll take some time to figure that out. First, we might observe that ""without faith it is impossible to please God (Hb.11:6).""ÿ And in another place Pauls says that ""whatever is not of faith is sin (Ro. 14:23).""ÿ So you might say that ""faith"" is very important.ÿ Have we ever studied exactly what faith is in here?ÿ Perhaps not.ÿ Let's review quickly, if that is possible. To begin with, faith is always set in opposition to ""works"".ÿ For some verses on this we might look to Rom. 4:4,5.ÿ Look how Paul contrasts these two ideas, as if they were two economies.ÿ ""If you work, you get what's coming.""ÿ If you punch the clock, you get the check.ÿ Furthermore, if you don't get paid, you'll have a thing or two to say to that boss (like our employees).ÿ Well... you can do that with God too.ÿ He makes it plain enough in scripture, that if you want what you worked for, its yours.ÿ But you may be surprised... On the other hand, you can place your faith in God to give you what you didn't work for, what you don't deserve.ÿ This is how we receive eternal life.ÿ Clear enough?ÿ Good.ÿ (By the way, this contrast is rife throughout the scriptures.ÿ I only gave you one instance, but I could have given many more). Now let's turn to James 2.ÿ This passage gives us a little different perspective on the issue.ÿ Look at verse 14, ""What use is it...""ÿ Look again at verse 17, ""Even so, faith if it has no works is dead...""ÿ Now were getting a totally opposite view on the faith/works issue.ÿ Confused?ÿ I hope so, I often am. One of the most helpful passages for me has been Heb.11:1-6.ÿ This is the passage where faith is defined most clearly in the Bible.ÿ He begins by saying that ""faith is the assurance of things hoped for..""ÿ This is an exciting verse by itself.ÿ He is saying that faith is like the smell of good food or something like that.ÿ When you smell Rick baking a cake, you can tell that there is a source.ÿ You may not be able to see the cake, but you can almost taste it by the smell.ÿ There is an evidence of something you can't see.ÿ Faith is like that. I had the fortunate experience of living in a house where my parents, were totally dedicated to the Lord. ÿThey did everything for Christ.ÿ Later, I got to know some other folks who were the same way.ÿ Now when people do this, it makes you wonder.ÿ I have never been an atheist.ÿ When you see people give their life to the Lord this way, you either have to say they are nuts, dellusionary, self-deceived, etc.ÿ Or you have to admit that there is something to it.ÿ By the way, I confess that I am irreverant enough to say that my parents are nuts.ÿ I'm waiting for senility to set in...ÿ But their absolute sanity and wisdom had to be a result of their Christianity... Faith is like this.ÿ You can tell a God is there, even when you can't see Him, because His people excercize faith.ÿ This chapter goes on to show how people gave their lives for Him... Note also verse 6, ""..that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him..""ÿ This explains it for me.ÿ If you believe that He is there, and that He has a reward for those who seek Him, you will seek Him!ÿ Its that simple.ÿ Not really, all kinds of stuff gets in the way... So we have faith.ÿ Faith is indespensable.ÿ Aren't all these texts saying it is important?ÿ But in I Cor. 13 Paul says that Love is greater than either faith or hope.ÿ Maybe we can share some ideas on why this is and how this is. Back in Colossians, Paul indicates that love is rooted in hope.ÿ Hope is actually one of the causes of love.ÿ This is an interesting relationship.ÿ We see it demonstrated all the time.ÿ For example, when we see someone who is intensly selfish, hoarding things, they see opportunities for advancement in people and things... You can be sure that this person has no concept of what God could do for him/her.ÿ They genuinely feel that if they don't look out for themselves, no one will.ÿ But that is a lie.ÿ The truth is that God does want to look out for us... This is hope. Sets you free to get into others.. Finally, Paul says in verse 6 that ""the gospel"" is constantly bearing fruit wherever it goes.ÿ This is good news.ÿ It is also something Paul does pretty consistently.ÿ He reminds his readers of what is going on throughout the rest of the world.ÿ That people are getting saved elsewhere.ÿ This is really healthy.ÿ The Church at Colossae had the same tendency the rest of us have.ÿ We can begin to think that this here is the extent of God's work.ÿ He's doing some things in the rest of the world that are really exciting.ÿ I think that it is His will that every Christian begin to see His work in the whole world.ÿ This is part of a whole perspective. You see, we may think it is pretensious or ""out of our league"" to try and keep up with and even be involved with God's work throughout the whole world.ÿ God doesn't see you that way.ÿ Xians are actually the only folks who really understand what it is all about.ÿ One of the best ways to get this kind of perspective is to read some books about the way God works in the world.ÿ See Acts, Exodos, Genisis, Kings, Chronicles, Prophecy... <h2><span style=""color: #000000""><span style=""line-height: 34px""> </span></span></h2>",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t02302s.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1993 - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 1: God's Communication- Jesus (College Central Teaching)",1988-01-31,,"  Writing to correct perceived problems One thing we may want to keep in mind about this letter is that Paul did not know these people.ÿ The Church had been planted by another worker.ÿ So these were strangers to Paul. How would you write a letter to strangers?ÿ What tone would you have?ÿ Would you be direct and straightforward?ÿ etc. etc. What makes matters more interesting is that he seems to be writing the Colossians because of a falsehood in their Church.ÿ There were some teaching false doctrine.ÿ And the falsehood that was circulating wasn't just a matter of getting communion in those little cups versus a large goblet.ÿ It wasn't just a matter of whether you sprinkle water in baptism or actuall imerse them.ÿ The controversy which had sprung up in Colossae was related to the identity of Christ himself.ÿ They were confused on this issue.ÿ And there were other problems just as serious. So Paul isn't just writing a newsletter to let them know how the mission is going.ÿ There is a little tension in the air.ÿ He has to refute a doctrine, hoping they don't just write him off in the process.ÿ ""Who is the Paul character anyway?"" So he writes a letter.ÿ Yet it's a small letter.ÿ And it is mild, a nice letter. I think in light of the grave consequences of error in these matters, and the fact that he had never met these people, he is really putting a lot of trust in the power of a letter. And that is exactly the point I want to make here.ÿ Paul believed that instruction, straightforward, to-the-point instruction would change people's lives.ÿ He believed this because he was dealing with Christians, who had God's Spirit in them.ÿ And Paul knew that he could say something, and God's Spirit would drive it home. He didn't have to belabor it.ÿ He didn't have to say it harshly.ÿ He didn't have to write 5 letters (at least that we know of).ÿ He simply instructed them and counted on the Spirit of God to come through and teach. I believe this is one of the marks of experience.ÿ I believe those who are the most experienced with God and his power to change us know how little we have to do.ÿ We need to remind each-other of God's powerful word--God's powerful perspective. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember a few years back I was reading a book with an older Christian about being a worker for the Lord.ÿ The chapter we were discussing was on the topic of ""the need to be a lover of all types of people.""ÿ He simply said, ""I wonder of you're that way?""ÿ I assured him that the book had been writen about me and there was nothing to worry aboutÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But both of us knew full well that I was a very exclusive person, still am to a lesser extent.ÿ And that comment is absolutely unforgetable!ÿ It continually comes to my mind in various situations.ÿ Now I would have been tempted to handle things a little different.ÿ When I am aware that someone has a problem with a certain area, my tendency is to give that person a huge book list, and a long sermonÿ.ÿ.ÿ. How many comments and viewpoints from older brothers and sisters in the Lord do you still have circulating in your head?ÿ I've got a whole bunch. Now, I don't want to downplay the significance of developing our own persuasive abilities.ÿ But I want to emphasize God's incredible abilities in this area.ÿ And I want to give us an appreciation for what his word can do.ÿ It tends to stick. This is what we're going to see with Paul here as we continue in Colossians.ÿ Let's read beginning in vs. 13ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Christ The main concern here is the second person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ.ÿ He pops up here in vs.13, ""the beloved son.""ÿ And now, Paul is going into a long discussion of who he is and what he is all about. Paul has just finished talking about God the Father.ÿ And now he is talking about the Son.ÿ I know this is a confusing teaching of Christianity.ÿ But let me put it this way: I think it is fair to distinguish between someone's nature and someone's personalityÿ.ÿ.ÿ. What we are saying about God is that there are three people, sharing in that nature. Since we are ""Christians""ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I suppose this is good that we have passages in the Bible like this, since we are <em>Christians</em>.ÿ The term Christian is supposed to mean ""Christ's person."" So it's good that we have a description of him like this. Image of God I want to start with vs. 15 because this is where Paul really gets into an explanation of who this Jesus character is. He says he is the image of the invisible God.ÿ And by this he means that Christ is the physical representation of God to us.ÿ Now this is an important concept because, as John says, no one has seen God, and yet Christ is God, and he comes to explain to us as much as we can understand about himself. Personal God This whole idea of God coming to reveal himself is tied to the Christian concept that we have a personal God.ÿ That is, we have a God who is a person, like you and me.ÿ Not a human, a person. And we share this concept only with a couple other religions, Judaism and Islam.ÿ And all three religions spring out of the same bed of the ancient Jewish scriptures we now call the ""Old Testament."" Here the idea of a personal God who acts in history is recorded through the writings of the prophets, who claimed to have direct revelation from him. We have personality Francis Schaeffer, in his two books, <em>The God who is There</em>, and <em>He is There and He is Not Silent</em>, makes the case that we are more than a <em>thing</em>.ÿ We are more than a animal or beast.ÿ But we have that elusive element called ""personhood"" or ""soul."" And I find he is not unique in thinking this way.ÿ I find most people do, in fact, think this way.ÿ Most would agreeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Well, then, it makes sense to assume that there is a cause for that non-material, elusive element called ""person.""ÿ And that cause must be of the same kind of stuff. So, the argument goes, if you agree that there is an original cause, called God, or whatever, then it is reasonable to assume that God is a personal God because at one point in his creation he injected something.ÿ At one point he left a signature that is distinctive: the human being. Now, I know you may not even agree that there is such a thing as an original cause, call him God or whatever.ÿ If that is the case, I'm sure you will have the intellectual integrity to investigate why so many people do hold that, at the same time as their sanityÿ.ÿ.ÿ. If you agree you are a person, that is, more than plain old stuff, it is hard to imagine a sufficient cause for that outside of a personal God. And this is exactly what Gen. 1, 2 insist.ÿ God has left his stamp on the creationÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Persons communicate Well, it is hard to nail down what it is that makes us unique as persons.ÿ Anthropologists have struggled with this question for quite some time now. But one thing, I think that is more or less agreed upon is that whatever we are going to isolate and call ""person"" will be found in our communication.ÿ That is what we can observe. It is through your communication that you express your personality.ÿ It is through your communication that you express your will, your emotion, your original thought. So, from the outside, it has been communication, in its various forms, that has served as a means of identifying ""people.""ÿ It is essential to being a person. If God is a person, it is not outrageous to think he would communicate.ÿ In fact, it seems unreasonable to think that he would not.ÿ That's what people do.ÿ They communicate. So the question is, ""has God communicated to the beings he supposedly created?""ÿ And, ""If so, where?"" The Bible Well, for one, the Christians and Jews agree that he has communicated through men, prophets, and composed a body of text we call the Bible. By the way, the three texts I mentioned are the only ones which claim the position of scripture revealed from God. Christ And secondly, what this passage is drawing attention to is that Christ has also come to communicate personally what he is like. Firstborn This term is easily deceptive because it is not a term we use anymore.ÿ In the ancient world it was an idiom used to describe the one who benefits, the one who all this is for.ÿ And it obviously stems from the very firm traditions of primogeniture: that the one who is first born inherits the ranch. So to be called ""firstborn"" doesn't tell us something about his origin, that he was ""born"" at some point.ÿ It tells us something about the fact that he is the one in chargeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There are instances of God himself being called ""firstborn"" in Jewish literature. This is drawn out in the next verse, as Paul goes on to explain that he was the agent of creationÿ.ÿ.ÿ. ""All things have been created by him and <em>for him</em>"" is precisely the same idea as being the ""firstborn."" Before all thingsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. all thing hold together He goes on and reiterates that Christ was before all things.ÿ And he now adds the idea that Christ is the ground of things, even now.ÿ That even now, all things hold together because of him. Well, OK.ÿ Paul is trying as clearly as he can to describe God to us.ÿ The one who was before any caused thing.ÿ The one who defines and sustains the world we live in. But, you see, the striking thing is, this guy came and lived among mankind.ÿ Some how or another, he was able to confine himself to a human body, and as fully as possible, represent himself. Shedds a new light on Christ This sheds an incredible amount of light on Jesus Christ.ÿ But even more importantly for us, it sheds a whole new light on the accounts of his life, the historical records we know as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. I know there is the tendency to think, ""You know, that Jesus character was something else!ÿ What a guy!""ÿ And some of the stories he told are fascinating.ÿ And we're taken back by his cleverness at times. But what Paul is saying here is taht those records reveal the words, actions, humor, cleverness, and responses of God!ÿ What would God do ifÿ.ÿ.ÿ.? How many have seen it this way? I really wonder how many people have seen things this way as far as the gospel records.ÿ And if you haven't, I challenge you to read those books with that in mind.ÿ Read those books, asking yourself, ""could it be that this character really is who he claimed to be?ÿ God himself?"" And I want to tell you, that experience alone has been enough to turn many skeptics into Christians. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: And what's more, those books are not difficult to understand.ÿ They aren't like a mysterious saying. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Read from Hindu scriptures. Rig Veda 10:129 - Then there was not non-existence nor existence.ÿ There was no realm of air, nor sky beyond it.ÿ What covered it?ÿ And where?ÿ And what gave shelter?ÿ Was water there?ÿ Unfathomed depth of water?ÿ Death was not then, nor was there ought-imortal.ÿ No sign was there.ÿ The days and nights' divider.ÿ That one thing, breathless, breathed by it's own nature.ÿ Apart from it was nothing whatsoever.ÿ Darkness, there was.ÿ At first concealed in darkness the all was undiferentiated chaos.ÿ All that existed was void and formless.ÿ By the great power of warmth was born that one. Thereafter rose desire in the beginning.ÿ Desire, that primal and germ of spirit.ÿ Sages who search with hearts' thought, discovered that existence's kinship was non-existence.ÿ Transversley was their serving line extended.ÿ What was above then?ÿ And what below it? Now I don't want to belittle another religious view just because their writings are difficult.ÿ Nor do I want to say that the truthfulness of a view is somehow related to how easy it is to read.ÿ Nor do I want to pretend that there aren't any things in the Bible that are hard to understand.ÿ There are. But I'm dealing with a perception here.ÿ I think most people have a perception of the Bible or of ""scriptures"" that they are difficult and downright confusing.ÿ And even if you did take the time to muddle through them, you wouldn't benefit. That is so untrue, especially when it comes to the life of Christ revealed to us in these four historical books.ÿ They are understandable, intriguing, and I am convinced you have never read anything like them before. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here's a selection from the book of John.ÿ And I think that the book of John is a great one to read, by the way.ÿ (read from Johnÿ8). What a great story!ÿ This one is usually good enough to even make it in the movies about Jesus.ÿ And there are lots of stories like that.ÿ And there are lots of things Christ said that just make your head spin. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Luke 6:39-45 Here's a pack of great sayings.ÿ Have you ever wondered why religious types bother you so much?ÿ Well, they bothered Jesus Christ too.ÿ They bother God.ÿ And Christ is offering what I consider to be powerful insight on why.ÿ For one he says, ""they're like blind guides.ÿ They're just the same as you and me.ÿ And if we have a problem, don't think the know-it-all religious type has it together any more than you."" And he goes on to cement that.ÿ ""It's like saying, `here, let me help you with that speck in your eye.'""ÿ And you've got some huge thing sticking out of your eye. And then he lays down the real insight: The problem with religious people is that they think smacking someone's wrists cures their heart.ÿ They think a band-aid cures cancer.ÿ They think they can clean up the outside and it changes the way they are one the inside! Wrong.ÿ And of course Christ's solution is that God needs to actually come and do a gradual, but thorough renewal of our very character.ÿ And it's nothing to get prideful about because it's him.ÿ And it's nothing to get religious about either, as we'll see in a moment. But this kind of great stuff is typical of Jesus Christ.ÿ And I think you can understand why, if you realize this is no ordinary character.ÿ This is God.ÿ What great insight into the way God thinks. But there is more than simply coming to communicate But going back to Colossians 1, I want to note taht there was more to Jesus Christ than simply communicating to us about God and revealing to us the way God is. Read vs.19-22 You see, the crux of Jesus' mission was to do much more than just reveal himself to us.ÿ He came to make peace.ÿ As Paul says, he came to reconcile. Now I know you may be saying to yourself, ""well, he didn't have to do that really, I feel OK about God.ÿ I mean, I don't feel particularly bad about him.ÿ Sure, we can have peace."" But you see, the problem was on his part.ÿ And it is called ""God's justice.""ÿ You see, as Paul says here, there are these things called ""evil deeds""ÿ and there is even a problem with a hostile set of thoughts.ÿ God has a problem with the way we even think. Some don't feel ""evil"" or ""hostile Now, before you get offended by that, remember one thing, you do to.ÿ There are types of actions that offend your sense of justice.ÿ And there are ways of thinking that you thing are wrong.ÿ And you may say to yourself, ""well, but I leave people alone to do whatever they want.""ÿ That's because you're not God.ÿ If you were God, I think you would have a little more right to not only be offended by the things people do and think, but act on that. Now I also know that it's this kind of talk that gets people riled up about the Bible.ÿ It seems so un-civil to refer to people as commiting ""evil deeds"" or ""hostile in mind.""ÿ This is especially hard when you don't feel like you are evil or hostile. But I think we have to face the fact, that none of us are truly objective or fair when it comes to ourselves.ÿ Everything we do has a ""good reason"" if you're like me. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I don't just go around hating people.ÿ I only hate people who are really foolish and deserve it! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here was a guy I watched yesterday who came up to a check-out counter from the opposite side.ÿ I was going through on the one side, and he came up from the other.ÿ And he had an item in his hand he had just grabbed from in the store.ÿ So he said, ""I just want to ask a question.""ÿ The clerk didn't notice him.ÿ So, he turned around and walked out of the store, with the item.ÿ And I know what he was thinking, ""If they're too busy for my question, then they need to be punished!"" Now if you asked a person like that, or me when I hate someone, ""Do you think God would judge you for that?""ÿ What do you think the answer would be?ÿ ""Of course not!ÿ They deserved it!"" So we rationalize everything.ÿ Even when it comes to screw-ups that aren't ""someone else's fault,"" we rationalize them too. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If someone goes out and comits adultery on his wife, what's the reaction?ÿ ""I was wrong!ÿ I really did a bad thing!?""ÿ Not at all.ÿ The typical reaction is, ""I guess I'm only human!"" What is that supposed to mean?ÿ It means, ""I couldn't help myself, so get off my case!""ÿ We instantly absolve ourselves of any moral responsibility. But God is all good But the fact is, God is the one who's sense of justice will prevail in the universe.ÿ And the thing about him is, he's not only human.ÿ He's God. When he is wronged, he forgives and loves that person anyway. The thought of hurting another person is abhorrent to him, even if they do deserve it. In area after area, where we think it's no big deal, and that we have everything explained, God thinks it is a big deal.ÿ And as the founder of the universe, he has that right. But God forgives instead of judging But you know, this is where the real surprise of Christ's life comes in.ÿ Because instead of just being offended by what we do.ÿ Instead of just acting on his sense of justice.ÿ God came to make peace.ÿ God came personally to reconcile. And he did so by taking the judgment we deserved upon himself at the cross.ÿ This is what Paul means when he says, in verse 20, ""having made peace through the blood of the cross.""ÿ He exacted judgment on the things we do.ÿ But he did it on a substitute--himself. And the result is, as it says in vs. 22, we can be seen as ""holy and blameless.""ÿ Now I know that some of those words are outdated.ÿ But the idea is understandable.ÿ God doesn't want the things we do to come between us and him.ÿ So he comes and removes them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What did Christ intend to do about that dark picture he painted of human nature?ÿ Very simple, he intended to remove it as an obstacle by paying for it.ÿ God's justice is satisfied. Now the Bible tells us we can come to God in faith that Christ's death applies to us, and we can accept his free gift of forgiveness.ÿ We can be seen, as Paul says here, as blameless.

"Colossians 2: Love and Insight",1988-02-14,," <h1>Paul wants them to know . . .</h1> So this chapter begins with Paul wanting them to know about his struggles on their behalf.ÿ That is why he went into all that stuff Mark discussed last weekÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So their hearts may be encouraged.ÿ Paul is thinking of his audience now, and he is thinking, ""I want them to be encouraged by these stories.""ÿ That is why he is writing this letter.ÿ He wants them to be encouraged. And, he says something else he wants.ÿ He wants them to be ""knit together in love.""ÿ This is simply a metaphor for the way he would like to see this community of Christians behave.ÿ Paul is sitting back and thinking of the church at Colossae.ÿ He is thinking of the church at Laodocea.ÿ And he is thinking, ""Yea, I'd like to see those guys living like a church should, knit together in love.""ÿ That's the picture he has in mind as he is writing this letter. <h1>Love = Discernment</h1> Now, when I say that Paul wants the Colossians to be united together in love, that's certainly not surprising.ÿ Haven't we made that point here before?ÿ Yes, I think so. But what comes next is kind of interesting.ÿ Look at what he says love can do.ÿ In the NASB they translate, ""and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding."" <h2>NASB vs. NIV</h2> But, as usual, the translators of the NASB have followed their translation theory to the point of obscurity.ÿ If you don't know the translation theory of the various translations, let me tell you about it.ÿ The NASB translators worked on the belief that the most literal translation of the words, and a one-to-one corespondence with the original syntax would produce the most accurate translation.ÿ So, in other words, when they came to an idiom or complicated syntax, instead of smoothing it over, they left that to you. Well, there are some advantages of that theory.ÿ It is easier to study the words and their usage from the NASB.ÿ But the disadvantage is that it obscures the real meaning of the original sometimes by rendering an unneccearily complex translation.ÿ And this is one of those cases. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What connection is there between these disjointed phrases?ÿ ""that their hearts may be encouragedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assuranceÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ I'm going to bet that darn few people would be able to read over that and explain what Paul meant.ÿ It's just too awkward! And that's why it is that you will want to consult more than one translation of a passage like this oneÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Here's how the NIV translates verse 2: My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ. You see, the goal of these translators was clarity first.ÿ So, at times they may take more liberty with the text than the NASB translators.ÿ But often they will be more clear. This is why it is that if you want to really study a passage, then you will read more than one translation.ÿ Don't necessarily lean on one translation for your understanding.ÿ Compare them. <h2>Love gives rise to knowledge</h2> But let's get to the point.ÿ The point Paul is making here is that, somehow, being knit together in love will give rise to what he calls here the ""full riches of complete understanding."" Let me re-phrase the idea.ÿ He is saying that somehow loving one another gives you insight and discernment.ÿ Hmm, I wonder how this is? This, by the way, is not an unusual idea for Paul.ÿ He says the same thing in another book.ÿ In Philippiansÿ1:9, 10 Paul saysÿ.ÿ.ÿ. If you think this is an interesting idea, that love somehow is connected to knowledge, then I agree.ÿ Let me give you a couple ways this is true. <h3>Because Christian love is cognitive</h3> For one, Christian love involves knowledge.ÿ There is a cognitive aspect to Christian love. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: John talks about this in I John 3:18, where he says that we musn't love in words only, but in deeds and in truth.ÿ In other words, as I think we all know very well, saying ""I love you"" means nothing, if it's divorced from loving action.ÿ There has to be some weight behind those words. And, he also adds that love needs to consist of truth.ÿ That is to say, there are certain things that are love and certain things that aren't.ÿ And the truth, God's truth, discriminates between them.ÿ Love has be carried on within the confines of knowledge. Or, to say it more positively, knowledge gives us insight into how we can love. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Tell me if this isn't a common dilemma.ÿ You see something someone is doing, and you think, ""That's not right.ÿ I wonder if I should mention it?""ÿ And you're puzzled because you really want to know if this is your own gripe, whether you're just being petty, or whether it would really be the loving thing to do to bring this up to the person. I know for some of us, just the idea of thinking about it before we speak up would be a major accomplishment. But that is part of love, being knowledgable about what is good for people.ÿ When you love someone you want what is best for them.ÿ But what is best for them?ÿ What is good for them?ÿ Isn't that the debate?ÿ Isn't that what we all have differing opinions on? So, we need God's truth on the matter.ÿ And I think that one who intends to get into loving others will become knowledgable.ÿ The intention to love others demands that we know what is good for them.ÿ That means growing in knowledge. <h3>Because love balances knowledge</h3> But I think love gives rise to knowledge in a different way.ÿ And this may have been more crucial in the case of the Colossians.ÿ Love tempers, balances and corrects knowledge. Real love of other human beings puts all your theories to the test.ÿ A lifestyle of love is the greatest good.ÿ It's what it's all about, as we've made the case in here repeatedly.ÿ And the question is, do the things you think, do the things you believe, still allow you, still encourage and enable you to love other people? Paul is saying this is the litmus test for ideas.ÿ It is <strong>the</strong> acid test for ideas.ÿ And he can say this because we are human beings.ÿ We are relational.ÿ God created us to be able to love, and to actually thrive on love. Everything we believe has to come to terms with who we are.ÿ Does it help or hinder you from effectively loving other human beings? I say this is probably what Paul is thinking here because he knows these people have been buying into some wierd ideas.ÿ He knows they have been indulging some false teaching.ÿ We'll be seeing this more as the chapter goes on.ÿ So, he is saying that they need to pursue this goal of love--being knit together in love.ÿ And that in itself will lead them to a knowledge of what is really true. <h4>The human mindÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h4> You see, when it comes to knowledge, when it comes to things we can think up and support, the human mind is absolutely incredible.ÿ It is possible to think up and support just about any idea you want. And if you don't believe that, just go spend some time at an institution of higher learning.ÿ And if it's a seminary all the better.ÿ You'll find people there who believe everything.ÿ And they have darn good reasons, each in his own little head. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know as I studied a couple years back, people would ask me, ""What do you believe on this or that?""ÿ I could only say, ""I don't know.ÿ I'll have to see.""ÿ Because I realized everything made sense in the fishbowl.ÿ Everything made sense in the vacuum.ÿ I had to see what worked.ÿ I had to see what viewpoint, what perspective actualy worked in the relational realm. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I used to believe that when people had problems, they either needed a) proper instruction, or b) confrontation.ÿ So, people would come to me, ""Buck, I'm feeling down,"" or ""Buck I've got a problem.""ÿ And I would hear them out, and produce the remedy. I would say that that recipe worked great until I got married.ÿ I don't know how many theories about people and the nature of reality changed from that experience.ÿ But here I was, stuck with a person who didn't want to hear the truth.ÿ Here was a person who didn't want confrontation.ÿ Here was a person who just wanted to be understood.ÿ That's all. Let me tell you, there had been other people who had tried to pull that line on me.ÿ They would get more instruction or confrontation than the rest!ÿ But nobody else could get away with it.ÿ So I was forced to go back to the drawing-board and figure out what I really believed on that issue.ÿ And I began to find that God deals with us in a remarkably different way than I dealt with other people.ÿ He understands us.ÿ He accepts us.ÿ And you know what?ÿ Sometimes that's all! I just remember thinking, ""There's some people I need to apologize to."" There are many issues like that.ÿ There will be more.ÿ My faith, what I believe, is constantly being subject to the interogation of real-life relationships. And I have to say, as much as I believe in the power of the human mind, it is hopelessly subjective.ÿ I mean, we simply don't have the ability to tell if we have bad breath.ÿ That's the way it is with our thoughts.ÿ They have to come out in the open and be tried in the arena of human relationships.ÿ They have to co-exist with what God tells us about sacrificial love. <h4>Do you subject your beliefs?</h4> Do you subject your beliefs to this test?ÿ Do you look at your life and ask yourself, ""Is there real, meaningful, sacrificial love occurring between me and other humans?""ÿ And if it isn't there, which belief, or beliefs are wrong?ÿ There must be some reason you are isolated and don't have that rich quality of relationship. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Perhaps it's as simple as the belief that I've got to satisfy my own needs and wants, and then I'll be happy.ÿ There are people right here who believe thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The person who believes that is a lonely and unhappy person.ÿ It's not working! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I talked to a guy this week who had lots of relationships with folks.ÿ But in all of them, there was a subtle feeling of tension and alienation.ÿ And he felt like that was OK.ÿ He must have, it had been that way for years!<em></em> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know another Christian who tried to convince me that people needed to be punished for the wrong they did.ÿ ""When someone wrongs me, there must be retribution of some kind!""ÿ Her favorite thing was to not associate with that person any more.ÿ She was really getting them back, boy!ÿ But you see, anybody who knew her would be able to tell whether what she was saying is true.ÿ Her marriage told you it wasn't working.ÿ Her friendships, or lack thereof, told you it wasn't working.ÿ And the absolute void of love in her life told you it wasn't working. I don't know what you believe.ÿ I don't know what doctrines or theories you hold to.ÿ But if love is defficient in your life, or if biblical love is lacking altogether, then you have to ask yourself, ""What's wrong here?"" <h4>That's what Paul constantly reminded people of</h4> That's what Paul constantly reminded people of.ÿ In the book of Galatians, as he wrote to refute some false teaching they had, he came down to that in the end.ÿ In chapter 5 he takes the whole chapter to make that point.ÿ ""If you bite and devour each other, if you're boastful, challenging each other, what good is your stupid idea?"" And here with the Colossians, he doesn't challenge them that way.ÿ As we've noted before, he doesn't know them personally.ÿ But he does know that if he gives them the vision of being a community, knit together in love, and if they pursue that vision, then they will be that much safer against possible deception and false teaching. <h1>God's Mystery . . .</h1> The next thing Paul sees as a goal is that they would come to a knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ himself. <h2>Mysteries</h2> Now what he is making a veiled reference to here is something that the Colossians liked very much, ""mysteries"".ÿ Mysteries weren't like they are today.ÿ Today, when you think of a mystery you think of an Agatha Christi novel, or something. But a ""mystery"" in Paul's day was a truth that was veiled.ÿ It was a truth that was hard to find.ÿ And yet, to the discoverer of that truth, that one would receive spiritual enlightenment. This was a very popular thing.ÿ And people would do tricks, follow guru types, go through initiations, etc., in order to become enlightened and discover what lay behind the ""mystery."" There were literally hundreds of these mystery religions in the ancient Greek world.ÿ And they were very popular at the time of earliest Christianity.ÿ So, many feel, and there is good evidence to support this, that the source of some of the problems at the church of Colossae was that some of them were buying into these mystery religions.ÿ And they were mixing them with Christianity. So Paul is brining up the ""mystery"" here.ÿ ""Oh boy, you guys wanna know the mystery?""ÿ ""Yea, we wanna know the mystery!""ÿ ""Well get this.ÿ It's not an idea.ÿ It's not a trick.ÿ It's not a way of life.ÿ It's not even some secret information!ÿ It's a person!ÿ It's Jesus Christ!"" <h2>Relationship vs. Philosophy</h2> There is a subtle contrast Paul is bringing up here.ÿ And it is one that would be more evident to his readers.ÿ Paul is telling them that the real scoop is a person.ÿ Christianity is not an idea.ÿ Christianity is not a philosophy.ÿ It is a living relationship with a person. <h3>Not a philosophy</h3> Now when I say it is not a philosophy, I don't mean that Christianity does not deal with the answers.ÿ I'm not saying that it does not dialogue in philisophical terms.ÿ Obviously, being a skeptical and thinking person I believe that Christianity has answers for the questions raised by philosophy. But that is not what it is.ÿ Christianity has answers for us.ÿ But it is not just a system of thought or a point of view. It is a relationship. <h3>Not a religion</h3> Let me throw something else in here that Christianity is not.ÿ It is not a religion.ÿ I remember writing a paper on that topic for an English class: ""Christianity: the anti-religion.""ÿ My professor had to call me in and make sure I had my head screwed on straight. It's not a religion.ÿ A religion is, by definition, a system.ÿ A religion is a system of behaviors, a description of a lifestyle. Christianity is a relationship. It was this kind of confusion that many of the books of the Bible were written to confront.ÿ Because we so naturally think in terms of religion.ÿ We so naturally asume that what God wants is a specific lifestyle, spelled out in a set of rules. What God wants is a relationship. I know what you're thinking.ÿ Buck, so much of the Bible is full of rules, isn't it?ÿ At least that's what it seems like when I hear of it, there always seems to be some rule coming up. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was watching a show last week in which this liberal thinker had volunteered to give her point of view to a group of Christians (Don't ask me how they found someone so stupid to walk into a group of angry Christians).ÿ But one after one they walked up to the microphone and quoted a bunch of rules at her.ÿ I'll tell you, if I had been listening to that show as someone who didn't really know my Bible, I would be glad I didn'tÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h4>Why Laws?</h4> But I want to clarify why there are moral imperatives in the Bible.ÿ For one, God gives moral imperatives, rules if you will, as a paradigm, as an example of how to answer moral dilemmas.ÿ They are not intended to be followed slavishly.ÿ Now that's human nature.ÿ We like to put them onto plaques and write them into rule-books.ÿ But that was not God's intention.ÿ And so much is written in the Bible itself about the destructiveness of following an external, black and white set of codes.ÿ They are just principles.ÿ And God wants us to come to him personally for guidance.ÿ He wants us to rely on him personally for guidance, because Christianity is a relationship. But there is another reason rules are in there.ÿ They show us our own moral neediness.ÿ Laws, moral standards like the 10 Commandment actually serve to highlight our inadequacy. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I want to read you a passage, that if you are not familiar with it, will blow your mind.ÿ Romansÿ5:20 saysÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ And Paul tells us elsewhere that the way it increases is by exposure.ÿ A law comes in a flushes out your own desire to do something wrong. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember being up at school, and Mark and me were up there together.ÿ The first quarter we were up there, we read in the student handbook, about a rule where you weren't allowed to climb this bubble.ÿ It covered an ice rink.ÿ And they threatened you with expulsion if you did.ÿ Well, I had seen the bubble many times before.ÿ But I could never see it in the same light again.ÿ Somehow it had changed.ÿ Instead of being the bubble to cover the ice rink, it was now the bubble you weren't allowed to climb.ÿ I remember driving by it with Mark repeatedly and looking over, and both of us would be thinking the same thing, ""Oh, we can't climb that."" And God actually gave the laws in the Bible for that reason.ÿ You see, the idea here is that God intends us to look at something like the 10 commandments and realize, ""Hey, I'm not exactly a good person."" His desire is for us to conclude that we won't win his favor by being religious.ÿ What he wants instead is a relationship.ÿ And instead of trying to be good, and live up to some standard, what we need is forgiveness. <h4>If youÿ are considering Christianity . . .</h4> If you are one who is here considering Christianity, and if this is new stuff to you, then I want you to take this home and mull it over.ÿ And if you want this relationship with God, don't come to him religiously. Instead, realize, ""I am inadequate.ÿ I can't come to you on the basis of my own goodness.""",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t02304s.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1993 - Buck McCallum",

Sin,1989-02-06,," <h1>Intro:</h1> Being somewhat on the pessimistic side of things, I find myself envying those who can be positive no matter what.ÿ I think that from day to day they have a real advantage in a lot of ways. But then there are times when I think otherwise.ÿ When we turn to a topic like this morning's, sin, here is where being positive can be a barrier to appreciation. I'm going to lay out some of the scriptures on sin, along with some differing views on the doctrine of sin.ÿ And then we want to look at some applications of our view of sin. Why do people have chronic problems? But first, why is it that so many Christians will see only the most superficial change in their lives, and then that's it?ÿ We'll see some people come to Christ, and they may put away some of the excesses.ÿ They may start to give of their money, and some of these things.ÿ But as for the real dynamo and spiritual reality that we say should characterize the normal Christian, well it's just not there. I believe one reason for this is a failure to understand sin correctly.ÿ And I hope to show how that is. But I think another thing we'll see is people coming back to the same problems like habbits, again and again.ÿ It is frequent we'll see a Christian with an immorality problem.ÿ And over the course of years, they just can't really go very long without going back to that same old issue.ÿ ""Well, I've really learned the lesson this time!""ÿ But they haven't.ÿ And the go back. I think, once again, we really are dealing here with a faulty understanding of sin.ÿ I don't doubt that there may be other problems as well. But one problem there is a poor grasp on the matter of sin. Well, I could go on with several symptoms of this problem.ÿ But we'll get to some applications at the end.ÿ I just want you to know that this material has real, concrete application.ÿ In fact, application that is life and death, spiritually speaking. I need to say this because we are getting into a <em>theological</em> study, and people always wonder about <em>theological</em> studies--whether they're worth the effort. Well, they are.ÿ And I think it wouldn't hurt anyone to become steeped in what the Bible says about sin, any more than becoming steeped in what the Bible says about its cure. <h1>The words for sin</h1> First of all, the words for sin in the Bible are <em>hat`ah</em> in the OT and <em>hamartia</em> in the NT.ÿ They both mean, basically, ""to miss the mark.""ÿ So they are metaphorial terms drawn from secular usage. What you have to realize about these words, however, is that they came to mean, ""sin"" in a comprehensive sense.ÿ The term <em>hamartia</em> no longer refered exclusively to the act of sinning, but also to a fallen state, or a state of corruption. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: An example of this would be Rom.ÿ5:12, where Paul talks about sin as something that spreads through man's nature.ÿ In other words, the term has gone beyond signifying something someone does to denote a state of affairs.ÿ You can have this ""thing"" called ""sin"". However, the choice of the terms <em>hat`ah</em> and <em>hamartia</em> may indicate that sin can be measured by a standard. <h1>Falling short of a standard</h1> And so, the definition of sin can be seen as falling short of a standard.ÿ Or, to think scripturally, ""disobedience to God's commandments."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This is how it is defined in a passage like Jer.ÿ16:10, 11ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿÿ One thing interesting about this passage is how it links unfaithfulness to God with disobeying his commandments. So, both the terms for sin, and some passages we could look at seem to define sin in terms of violating a code. <h2>Unbelief</h2> On the other hand, there are those who have considered this definition entirely inadequate and would rather look at sin as ""unbelief."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This was Jesus' deal the the prideful Pharisees in Jhn.ÿ9:41, ""If you were blind you would have no sinÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Another passage that is fairly stark on this is Rom.ÿ14:23ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We'll discuss how these two views of sin can be harmonized and their implications in a bit. <h2>Original Sin</h2> But first, we need to look at where the Bible itself starts, original sin.ÿ This is the sin that Adam and Eve indulged in the Garden of Eden.ÿ If we can have some understanding here, then we would be in a better position to understand sin throughout man's history. <h2>The story</h2> The basics of the story are pretty amazing.ÿ God set up the first trial of mankind as a choice of different foods. The choice for sin was described in Gen. 2:16ff. as the ""Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.""ÿ So it is a pretty long title.ÿ Let's just look at the basic possibilities of what it could represent. <h1>The possibilities</h1> <h2>The tree was a test-case</h2> The tree could be seen as a test-case of obedience.ÿ The name of the tree expresses what it was whether they ate of it or not.ÿ Before eating, it was the sole source of knowledge on this topic.ÿ The tree was the ""test case"" or one example of the difference between obedience and disobedience, good and evil. This view of the tree would tend to emphasize the idea of obedience or disobediance.ÿ It would tend to stress the idea of sin as missing a standard. However, this view would not explain God's comment about the whole situation in Gen.ÿ3:22, ""Behold the man has become like us, knowing good and evilÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ I take this comment to mean that something happened to Adam and Eve. Somehow they changed.ÿ And the change is described by God as ""knowing good and evil,"" much like he did.ÿ Well, we know that God did not know good and evil experientially. Perhaps the change is a new faculty for discerning evil, independent of God. This is why some look at the tree as granting Adam and Eve a new ability.ÿ By chosing to eat the tree they were chosing to acquire a new knowledge about good and evil, independant of God.ÿ Adam and Eve could now make moral judgements on their own. This is backed up by the fact that immediately they knew they were naked. <h2>Guilt and Corruption</h2> I think one implication of this second view is that it tends to promote the idea that Adam and Eve immediately received corruption of their very nature.ÿ This independant faculty to judge good and evil in itself was somehow undesireable.ÿ In itself it was not a good thing, and therefore it can be seen as corruption. So, on the one hand, if Adam and Eve simply disobeyed, and as a result were judged, then the fruit they would inherit in their lives would be <em>guilt</em>.ÿ After the event they would be guilty, and therefore unworthy of fellowship with God. The second view would say that they are both <em>guilty</em>, and <em>corrupt</em>.ÿ Something actually happened to their nature as a result of their action. <h2>Mediation of Sin: Guilt and Corruption</h2> Well, this idea is picked up by Paul and he describes how we recieved guilt and/or corruption in Rom.ÿ5.ÿ Let's turn there to understand this issue better. <h1>Two historic views:</h1> As we look at this passage, I want to understand it from two viewpoints, two traditions of interpretation.ÿ The first is a heresy, or at least it has been ruled that way by a couple church councils: Pelagianism.ÿ The second is called Augustinianism, and has been seen as more or less the orthodox view of sin in church history. <h1>Pelagianism</h1> OK, the relevant passage is Rom. 5:12, Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned Pelagius, a fourth century British monk, argued that we did not inherit actual corruption from Adam.ÿ For one, Adam himself was not actually corrupted.ÿ Neither have we inherited it.ÿ Instead, Adam set an example of what it is to disobey, and we likewise follow in that example as a human race. In his view, you are born into the world more or less neutral.ÿ But then, through your own free choice you choose to sin.ÿ Then you are guilty, like Adam, and perhaps gradually corrupted also. So, what Paul is talking about in this passage is not corruption which has spread to all, but guilt. This is exactly what has happened according to Pelagius, because of the last phrase of v.ÿ12, ""because all sinned.""ÿ The point is that we are sinful like Adam because we chose to sin like Adam. The implication of Pelagius' view for human nature is that we have the ability to chose good.ÿ We have the ability to chose not to sin or to sin.ÿ Since we chose to sin, we are guilty and worthy of death. I want to reiterate what Pelagius taught.ÿ What Rom.ÿ5 is teaching is that we inherited Adam's sin only by immitation.ÿ This is plain from his understanding.ÿ It is not that something came to you from Adam which made you gravitate toward sin.ÿ Adam's role was only that of a bad example.ÿ Therefore, we are sinners in that we immitate this bad example. <h1>Augustinian</h1> On the other hand, Augustine came along and taught that our nature has been so corrupt, including our will, that we were incapable of chosing good.ÿ His favorite saying was, ""God, ask what you will and then give what you ask.""ÿ The point is that if God is going to ask anything of us, then he will have to provide it himself because we are incapable. How would Augustine read this same verse?ÿ He would say, this corruption called ""sin"" was introduced by Adam and passed down through the human race.ÿ And, he would say the phrase, ""because all sinned"" was not showing the cause of our corruption, but rather Paul was issuing proof of our corruption.ÿ In other words, ""It's obvious we all have sin and death because we all sin."" <h1>The correlation with Christ</h1> These two possible readings of the passage may be evaluated by looking at the larger context.ÿ Actually, Paul did not bring up the example of Adam just to talk about it.ÿ He brought up the example of Adam to illustrate something else, and that is the new life we now have in Christ. So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous. (Rom. 5:18, 19) So, there is a correlation.ÿ Somehow the progression from Adam, to sin, to death, is similar to that from Christÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (Put up chart showing progression from Adam&gt;&gt;deathÿ.ÿ.ÿ.) The question is, how has Christ's righteousness and resulting life come to us? Was there an actualy change of nature accompanying it?ÿ And the answer is, yes.ÿ The work of Christ first removes our guilt, but he also inhabits us with his Spirit, and there is a renewal of some kind which the Bible refers to as a ""new man"" or ""spirutal nature.""ÿ (Rom.ÿ8:9; Eph. 4:24) It may be nothing more than the fact that God's Spirit is now living inside of us.ÿ But it is an actual change, and a change of judicial status before God. So, we need to think about this correlation between Adam and Christ.ÿ If his effect on us was only that of bad example, then what Paul is teaching about Christ is that he has set a new example of obedience, which we can follow, and then we will be righteous like he and have life like he does.ÿ This is obviously ridiculous and heretical. So, if there is any corralation between these two persons and their effect on the human race, then it is a matter of transmitting both guilt and corruption on the one hand.ÿ And on the other hand, transmitting both righteousness and new life. <h1>Summary</h1> The point here is that Adam and Eve were actually corrupted by the act of disobedience.ÿ Beyond that, they were judicially guilty.ÿ And then they transmitted this to all humans.ÿ Sin is transmitted by propagation, not imitation. <h2>What kind of corruption?</h2> So, we know there was corruption.ÿ But the question remains, what kind? <h3>Original sin = independance</h3> Well, if we go back to our original sin, then this gives us insight.ÿ Here we thought that either Adam and Eve were just disobeying, or they were picking up a new ability to act independantly of God in the area of good and evil.ÿ You'll remember that the evidence in the story indicated that we inherited some kind of corruption.ÿ And this is confirmed by Paul's correlation with Christ. This, I believe, leads us to look at sin more as a problem of the heart than a problem of behavior.ÿ In other words, sin is a matter of not having the right dependance on God rather than not conforming to the correct standard.ÿ If you'll recall our initial definitions of the term, ""sin,"" this was one of the possiblities--that it refers to a lack of faith. Faith, if we defined it as dependance on God, would be just the opposite. <h3>Why the standards?</h3> Now, let's think about this even further.ÿ Why all the standards in the Bible?ÿ Why is sin defined as violation of a standard if it is really a matter of the heart, a matter of attitude? It's because a standard can measure the heart negatively.ÿ A standard can tell you that something is missing. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: So, if someone was into beating his wife, you could imagine he is not depending on God and exercising faith at that moment. But right here is where we need to be careful: If someone is not beating his wife, we know nothing of his heart attitude.ÿ Worse yet, if someone is ""loving"" his wife by all measures we can employ, we still don't know his heart attitude.ÿ In fact, with the biblical understanding of sin, you could be doing something that is good, according to thoroughly biblical standards, and yet be in sin as far as God is concerned. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Have you ever thought of Paul's words about love in this light?ÿ He goes through this list of things you could do without having love, and it is pretty impressive (giving all your money to the poor, giving your body as a sacrifice!)ÿ But at the end of each of these things, he says, ""if I don't have loveÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" What he is saying is that love is beyond any of those things.ÿ Love is a supernatural ability that comes only through real dependance on God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This is also why Paul says it is useless passing judgment on the moral quality of someone's work in IÿCor.ÿ4:5.ÿ He says, ""wait till the end, and then God will evaluate the motives of men's hearts and they will receive their praise from him."" Let me reiterate the point here.ÿ I could be doing something that, according to the standard, is morally correct.ÿ But I could still be in sin. This understanding of sin has tremendous implications on the goal of the Christian life, how we should go about it, and so forth.ÿ Let's get into some of those right now. <h1>Applications</h1> <h2>Trivializing sin</h2> Let's think first about the problem of both legalists and liscentious people.ÿ They both trivialize sin.ÿ By that I mean that they view it as light-heartedly as possible--something merely skin deep. <h2>Legalist: searing the conscience</h2> The legalist, on the one hand, will define sin and holiness in terms of an external code--which by the way, is usually somewhat keepable.ÿ Usually we select certain portions of God's standards and hold them up as the goal of holiness.ÿ Because, truly, if we were open to the whole of God's standards we would be exposed for what we are. But the legalist looks at a standard, a biblical standard mind you, and says, ""This is what it is to be in God's will.""ÿ And that is why a legalist can be so hard on people.ÿ You see, his conscience is satisfied by the keeping of a standard.ÿ So he is able, then, to turn on others with a great deal of self-confidence back-patting.ÿ His conscience tells him nothing is wrong. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How else can you explain something like Jimmy Swaggart calling Jim Bakker a slime on the face of the church?ÿ It's because he had a standard, an external standard.ÿ And it said, ""If I actually touch the flesh of another woman, who I am not married to, then I'm a fornicator.ÿ But if I have her talk dirty to me, and just watch, then that's a greater degree of sanctification.ÿ I can still rail on that scum over there."" This is also why Christians can go to church, maybe do some devotions on a regular basis, keep their life generally free of filthiness, and then live every other waking moment for themselves; stingy with money; never doing anything that would cost them too much personally; and they still feel like they are living for God. What I'm saying is that people have a little mental check-list.ÿ And when the ask themselves, ""Am I being holy?"" they turn on the mental check-list and ask, ""well, have I done this sin? Have I done this one? etc."" <h2>Positive side: Desparately seeking God</h2> But if you really understood, you would realize that you could check positive on the whole list, and still be entirely in sin. I think that what the proper understanding of sin does is turn us into more desparate people.ÿ We realize that there needs to be something radical and thorough done to our character.ÿ And we begin to seek the Lord on that. I think the right view of sin adds humility.ÿ We stop asking the question, ""Have I done right?"" and start coming to God and sayin, ""I know I am wrong.ÿ My whole self is wrong and I need you."" See, a person with this attitude is doing something that Paul calls, ""walking in the Spirit.""ÿ And he says about a person like that, in Rom.ÿ8, that God will eventually transform him even to the standards. <h2>Negativity</h2> The second area I believe is really effected by our view of sin is our graciousness and positivism with others.ÿ It's like this.ÿ If you believed that sin was merely a matter of conformity to a standard, then you would confront people and address why they don't coform to the standard?ÿ ""You need to stop doing this!ÿ Don't you know it's a sin!?ÿ Then why don't you stop it!? But if you understand sin as we have described it, you would realize that the external behavior is actually just a symptom.ÿ And you could deal with the symptom, only to have the problem pop up somewhere else. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I could teach someone, ""Never, under any circumstances must you snap at people.ÿ It is a sin.""ÿ And it is a sin.ÿ But if we focus on that external behavior alone, then the person may stop snapping at people, and instead take up the worse habbit of discarding friends when they get angry at them.ÿ It's not as immediately noticeable.ÿ But it's the same underlying sin. So, I think the correct approach, both with other people and ourselves, is to realize that our behaviors are the result of deeper problems like refusing to believe the Lord in some area--unbelief.ÿ Or, put another way, they are symptoms of resisting God and being rebellious against God on some issue. And you would realize something else, correcting these problems takes time.ÿ If it is true that sin is a corruption that touches every corner of our nature, then we had better learn to have some patience with each-other because it's gonna be a while. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I could see in my friend the sin of spiritual laziness.ÿ And I could start in on the behavior, insisting that he correct it now.ÿ And I might get some reaction as long as I keep the pressure up from the outside. On the other hand, I could understand that this guy needs to come to some deep realizations about his own sinfulness.ÿ He needs to realize that spiritual laziness is a rejection of God and God's will for his life.ÿ He needs to begin to see himself as one who resists God and even rebels against God.ÿ Then, as he comes to terms with that deeper issue, he will start to take that laziness seriously. But in the meantime, I have to be patient.ÿ I have to accept that brother's laziness and realize it will probably be there tomorrow too.ÿ There is a certain graciousness that results. <h2>Self Effort</h2> Another result of not understanding sin can be that we get into self-effort.ÿ And this kind of sums it all up.ÿ If you view sin according to a standard, then it is conceivable that a human could keep it.ÿ And you might even try. And yet, from what we have said here this morning, that would be the very epitome of sin itself. <h2>Important Qualifiers</h2> I want to conclude with several important qualifiers to what I have said here. <h3>Standards are important</h3> First of all, I want to make it clear that external standards are important.ÿ God has given them.ÿ So they must be important. But what we have to understand is that the whole of God's standards in every detail are important.ÿ Not just this one and that one.ÿ And there is no human being alive who can keep his mental list of standards that exhaustive. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Someone could come to me and say, ""Did you notice your inappropriate language in that situation?""ÿ And I could say, ""Aahh, but did you notice that while you were noticing me, the person next to you was in great distress and needed someone to minister to him?ÿ You didn't love your neighbor!"" The point is, no part of God's standards can be elevated above the rest.ÿ This is why the word of God should serve as an instruction and conviction, but not as a check-list.ÿ In other words, I read God's word and let it instruct me about love and how to conduct myself.ÿ But I don't take the portion I just read, or my favorite portion, and turn it into a check-list that I'm trying to keep. <h3>External behavior is important</h3> Secondly, I want to point out that external, rote behavior is important.ÿ Often, and very often, I need to do what I know is right, and refrain from what I know is wrong, even though my heart attitude is far from God. This is for the simple reason that sin is costly.ÿ The big reason that God doesn't want us to get into it is because it hurts.ÿ So, you realize, ""Even if my heart attitude in this area hasn't been dealt with, I still need to do what is right because it would cost too much."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: A great example here is that even though I am lusting in my heart, I will not go ahead and fornicate because the Proverbs say I will be reduced to a loaf of bread. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Likewise, on the positive side, I will still continue to do God's work, and speak to people about him even though I suspect my heart is not right with God. Why?ÿ Here is the principle that is important: The cost of not doing so would be too great.ÿ I'm introducing the idea that some standards are more important because of their effect than others.ÿ And that could be a teaching in itself.ÿ But sufice it to say as a qualifier that there is a time for sheer obediance, even though my heart is not right. But here is the key: Don't then assume that you don't have a problem.ÿ Don't assume that you are righteous at that point.ÿ Just thank God that you didn't screw up.ÿ But don't assume that you are in God's will.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t02892.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Servant Team Meeting - Buck McCallum",

"Colossians 1: The Expansion of Christianity",1989-10-15,,"  <h1>The increasing gospel</h1> The thing that is amazing Paul is how fast and furiously the message of Jesus Christ is spreading.ÿ It had to be incredible to watch at the time.ÿ When had anything spread with such force as Christianity, and yet without a sword being raised. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Hundreds of years later, Islam would spread like fire throughout much of this same region.ÿ But one very persuasive element of the Muslim religion at the time was that those who resisted its expansion were put to death. And so it has been with many ideas, lifestyles and religions.ÿ They spread on the force of economics, they were enforced by powerful rulers, etc. But not Christianity!ÿ In fact, you stood to lose a lot if you were a Christian in these days. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Today, in America, it can be to your advantage to at least call yourself a Christian.ÿ Name one President of the United States who would not at least call himself a Christian?ÿ It would be suicide! But not so in Paul's day.ÿ You stood to lose a lot if you were a Christian.ÿ Here's the reason: The people of this culture actually considered the Christians to be ""atheists"".ÿ That was the main charge against them!ÿ And the reason why is that the Christians considered the idols of the day and the various gods to be nothing.ÿ ""What's Zeus by a figment of your imagination."" And while a lot of people thought that, the Christians openly stated it and acted on it.ÿ They had no regard for what the gods thought.ÿ They did the things that gods said weren't supposed to be done.ÿ And they basically lived as if there were none of these gods, only the one supreme God. Well, there was a serious practical problem with this. And that was that these gods were woven into the fabric of the state, the culture, the economy, everything. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It should come as no surprise that when a new emporer was installed, that Jupiter, the biggest Roman god, would also issue and oracle endorsing the new emporer. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It should be no surprise that silversmiths and crafstmen of all kinds made a substantial portion of their living from traficking in religious wares. And so, with this system of gods so deeply wedded to the system, here Christianity comes along and says, ""They're really nothing, in fact they don't even exist.""ÿ Some feathers were ruffled. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In fact, one story that Luke tells in the book of Acts is that the craftsmen from one city were being driven out of business because no one was buying their little effigies any moreÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, it was in the face of this kind of opposition that Christianity spread like wildfire. <h2>The power of the message</h2> And I'll tell you the reason Christianity spread so. ÿIt was because of the inate power of the message of Jesus Christ.ÿ When people were hearing about Jesus Christ for the first time, they couldn't believe their ears!ÿ It was gripping, and the implications were enormous! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In fact, Luke tells another story about when Paul went to Athens, and went directly to Mars Hill, which is just below the Parthenon.ÿ And here, Luke tells us, people gathered and did nothing all day but hear new ideas.ÿ So, the point is that these people had heard just about everything you could hear.ÿ Right?ÿ So you could imagine the cynicism in these men's hearts.ÿ (That's what always drove me crazy about the philosophy students down at OSU.ÿ They always thought they had heard everything before, and of course knew the 5 weaknesses with every positions.ÿ ""Have you heardÿ.ÿ.ÿ.?""ÿ ""Of course, that's simply a variation of the Aristotelean distinction between nature and formÿ.ÿ.ÿ."") But the amazing thing is this: When Paul started into the message of Jesus Christ, the reaction from these guys was, ""No way!ÿ That's ridiculous!""ÿ And they were scoffing and laughing.ÿ Why?ÿ Because they had never heard anything like it before!ÿ And they concluded, we will hear more of this from you tommorow! The message of Christ even ruffled the feathers of these old cynics. And to the average person who heard about Christ, it was incredible. <h2>Hardest audience is right here</h2> You see, you might think that the people who are most resistant to Christianity are those who have never heard it before.ÿ But that's not true at all.ÿ In fact, the people who are most dull to the message of Christianity are those who have heard about Christianity so much that they think they know what it's all about. That's why places like Americal and Europe are the most dense and resistant to the message of Christianity.ÿ They're ""Christian countries,"" meaning that they supposedly are predominantly Christianized.ÿ And when you mention Jesus Christ, or Christianity, then everyone thinks they know what it's all about.ÿ Everybody has their own idea and now they see the message of Christ through their pre-conceived notions. I have a lot of these myself.ÿ And it is real hard to get me to see things a different way once I have an image in my mind. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have an image of what musicals are all about.ÿ They're stupid.ÿ No one will ever convince me that a musical is worth watching.ÿ Because it is stupid to be watching a couple people talking, and one of them breaks out into song about it!ÿ Or you're watching a scene, and the camera pans over to someone singing and dancing about it!ÿ So, just when I was convinced about this, comes along MTVÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ But I'm still not going to watch any musicals. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have the same image about those romance novels at the grocery store.ÿ There is no way one of those could ever be worth reading.ÿ There is no way an author of any calibre could write one.ÿ Right?ÿ But let me tell you something else.ÿ I have never read one!ÿ I have never so much as picked one up to browse out of curiosity!ÿ Because they're obviously stupid! And this goes to show one very important thing about our impressions.ÿ They can be indellible.ÿ They can be immovable, while at the same time absolutely unfounded.ÿ We may know absolutely nothing about the actual substance of something, but if we have an impression, that's it.ÿ We never will learn about the substance of that thing. Now some folks consider themselves open-minded.ÿ But honestly, I don't know if I've ever met an open minded person.ÿ At this point, I'm not sure they even exist.ÿ Sure, everyone has a realm of ideas they're open to.ÿ And yet, at the same time, everyone has a realm of ideas and experiences they are closed to. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: My neighbors are into country music.ÿ And now their little kid, who's about 10 is blaring country music every dayÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I consider myself to be open minded.ÿ In fact, I've always considered that to be a real strong point!ÿ But you already know how I feel about romance novels and country music.ÿ So, I guess I'm not completely open.ÿ My wife says I'm totally close mindedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Only with things that are stupid. But nowhere will you find more preconceived notions than with Christianity. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I love asking people about their idea of Christianity.ÿ The reaction is always the same.ÿ It's incredible.ÿ ""What do you think about Christianity?ÿ What do you think is involved?""ÿ And people will look at you for a while.ÿ And then they'll say something like this, ""It's OK, It's a good thing for people to be into.""ÿ And translated, that means, ""I know you're into this stuff, so you wouldn't like it if I told you what I really think."" Because what people really think is: <h3>1. It's boring</h3> <h3>2. It has no bearing on real life.</h3> <h3>3. It's particularly attractive to gullible, weak and foolish people.</h3> <h3>4. It's leaders take advantage of those gullible, weak and foolish people.</h3> &nbsp; And, depending on your background, you may have a few moreÿ.ÿ.ÿ. To get an impression of Christianity, all you have to do is drive down the street and see a church.ÿ It it a pompous structure.ÿ By that, I mean ""grand.""ÿ So, you think, that's what they must think they're into, something grand.ÿ And they have steeples.ÿ What do steeples tell you?ÿ Some of them look like they could hurt youÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Think what a European must think about God and Christianity.ÿ Their churches are all old, real oldÿ.ÿ.ÿ. For them, Christianity is probably kind of like Paul Bunyan or some other fairy tale. That's why it is that in cultures where Christians have been present for a long time, that is where it is hardest to get a hearing for Christianity. <h2>The good news isÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> But the fact is, when people take the time to stop and listen, the reaction is still the same.ÿ When people take the time to actually hearÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Let me tell you in a nutshell what is so moving and amazing about the Christian message.ÿ And seriously, just take the next couple minutes and pretend you are hearing about a completely new religion, one that you've never heard before. The Bible says that Christianity is actually not a religion at all.ÿ But that it is a personal relationship with God himself.ÿ And that we can meet the personal God, and get to know him just as we would another person.ÿ But, here is the part that people can't really believe: God in the Bible, offers to begin that relationship by completely forgiving us and accepting us as we are, <strong>with no strings attached</strong>. In other words, God does not call on anyone to improve themselves.ÿ God does not call on anyone to go to church.ÿ He doesn't call on us to do one thing in order to have his forgiveness and a relationship with him. Now I can guarentee, if you were listening, there were some of you here that heard something that you didn't really know about Christianity.ÿ Let me extrapolate further for the true shock effect to set in. What I'm saying is that God will forgive anyone, right now for the asking.ÿ Let's suppose they are currently involved in sex, drugs and rock and roll.ÿ God will forgive that person right now.ÿ Let's say a person is involved in a Satanist cult!ÿ God will forgive that person right now. Let's go further.ÿ Let's say that person continues tomorrow to be involved in sex, drugs, and rock and roll?ÿ God's forgiveness and acceptance does not change! Now we're getting a picture for just how amazing this message of Jesus Christ really is.ÿ And it is called the message of Jesus Christ because it is because of Jesus Christ that we can have God's forgiveness and acceptanceÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Still affective today</h2> Well, this message had real impact in Paul's day, when the religions of the day offered no hope at all to their believers.ÿ The gods weren't even really interested in human affairs, except as they affected them.ÿ The gods were self-seeking, self-centered gods, much like the human rulers they endorsed. And along comes this message that actually, God is immense enough to notice everyone.ÿ A God who is infinite, and gave rise to everything.ÿ But at the same time, is personal enough to be involed with your life and mineÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The net effect was, ""If that's true, it has to be the most awesome thing I've ever heardÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Well, the fact is, wherever Christianity is given an ear today, it is still having the same effect.ÿ Here in America, where people are convinced, once they've seen one T.V. preacher, ""I know what Christianity is about!""ÿ If they only give an ear for a little while to the message of Jesus Christ, their reaction is always the same: ""No way!ÿ No way!"" That's when I know I've hit home.ÿ That's when I know someone has actually heard, when the have that reaction of, ""No way!"" <h1>Knowledge of God's will</h1> It's interesting then, that the first thing Paul mentions in v.ÿ9 is this (read verse).ÿ You see?ÿ He begins to pray that these people will understand God's will.ÿ That's because he knows that a knowledge of God's will is a powerful thing, if only people knew it. It's just like the message of Jesus Christ.ÿ Here is this awesome truth, the truth of God's love and acceptance.ÿ And it's waiting to effect people, if only they knew it! That's the way knowledge from God is.ÿ It's powerful.ÿ It shakes things up.ÿ It changes things.ÿ But the problem is, people don't know it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In Pro. 29, it says, ""Where there is no revelation from God, the people lose it, but where God's word is people are happy."" So, Paul knows that what these people need is knowledge from God.ÿ If they have that, then a lot of other things will fall in place. <h2>They were without</h2> Now, one reason Paul had to really pray for this with these people was that they were really at a disadvantage.ÿ They did not have, usually, a written copy of God's word.ÿ So, they were in the precarious position of having to wonder, ""What is God's will in this situation?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You would be thinking about getting married to someone, and you could only wonder, ""What does God have to say about this?"" And these people would really have to seek out the Lord and look for guidance.ÿ They would have to seek the counsel of the older Christians to see what they knew about stuffÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>A precious deposit</h2> But today, we have God's word right here in our hands.ÿ This is like no other time in history, when every person can have their own copy of God's written wisdom.ÿ Most Christians in America have several. Paul's prayer to us would be a little different.ÿ Instead of ""I pray you be filled with the knowledge of God's will.""ÿ He would pray, ""I pray you would read and apply that book you have in your hands."" He knows that a knowledge of God's will is the answer to the issues of life.ÿ A knowledge of God's will is the stuff people are scratching for, but they can't find it. <h3>People don't have it</h3> In I Cor. 2, Paul says that the deposit of truth we have from God is so wonderful, that eyes have never seen it, ears have never heard it, and it has not even entered the imagination of man. In other words, the truths we learn from God--God's wisdom, the answers he provides for us, what Paul calls here, ""God's will""--are truths that are deeper than anything man has ever come up with on his own. All our powers of observation haven't turned up the real answer to life. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In the area of science, we have turned up some amazing things.ÿ And I am impressedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But that same scientist, who could explain the structure of DNA, and I still wouldn't understand it, will then turn around and go home to a marriage he can't figure out.ÿ He can't make it work. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Historians and those who study people, they've found out some amazing things.ÿ But that same man, who researchedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. will go home and he will still be lonely.ÿ Because he doesn't have the answer to that problem! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: And our imagination.ÿ Wow!ÿ What an amazing thing!ÿ What is there that human minds haven't imagined?!ÿ I'll tell you what.ÿ We have never been able to imagine the real answers to our problems.ÿ Because the same person who is so intensely creative with his imagination, will still die--and you cannot imagine your way out of that hole. See?ÿ These are the real issues of life!ÿ We've gone so far on some of these peripheral issues, like how to transport ourselves faster and how to get more comfortable.ÿ But we haven't made any progress at all on the real issues: How to get along with another person, how to escape lonliness and boredom, how to escape extinction. <h3>We have the answers</h3> But the power of God's word is that it contains these very answers.ÿ God, the designer of human beings, has left us with insight into how they work. That's what God's word is all about. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What do you do when you're wondering about how serious to get about a guy or a girl?ÿ God's word has the answer to that question. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What do you do when it seems like you can't really get along with anone in your life?ÿ God's word has the answerÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>We need to learn how to apply</h3> You know what the problem is though?ÿ You and I have to learn how to handle it.ÿ And that is no easy task.ÿ What it involves is learning how to take what God said to people back then, and distill from it a principle, which can then be applied today. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We can go to Jesus' teachings, which are truly amazing pieces of wisdom.ÿ And he taught on so many things.ÿ But one of my favorites is where Jesus teaches on anxiety.ÿ Here's a problem that literally ruins people--people who know everything about their field, virtually killed by anxiety.ÿ So, Jesus comes along and says, ""Look, God knows when a sparrow falls to the ground.ÿ God knowsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and if God knows all this, then why are you anxious?ÿ Pray to God instead.""ÿ And then, as a kicker, he says, ""Seek to serve God, and he will take care of you, and your anxieties will vanish!"" That's a fascinating concept.ÿ And people are always turned on by that kind of thing.ÿ But it's still not far enough.ÿ It's still not going to help me.ÿ Because what does he mean when he says, ""Seek to serve God?""ÿ How do you do that? And so, someone who knows a little more of God's word will know from passages like Gal.ÿ6:10, and Hebrews 10:25 that a big part of seeking to serve God is seeking to love and serve other Christians. But that still doesn't go far enough.ÿ In order to truly benefit from God's wisdom, I need to be able to practically apply it to my life, right now!ÿ I have to be sitting there at my house, and know, ""Instead of sitting here and worrying, and getting into myself, I need to get up, go to a meeting or find some fellowship with Christians, and try to find a way to serve them."" That's the kind of brass-tacks, practical stuff that is involved in God's wisdom. <h3>It takes work</h3> And if you have tried to apply God's word to today, you know that it takes some work.ÿ It's not exactly easy. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I'm teaching a class right now on interpretation.ÿ And the reaction I get is always the same, ""Hey!ÿ This is hard!ÿ Why is it so hard?"" I don't know.ÿ Why is math hard?ÿ Why is learning how to use a computer hard?ÿ Why is learning a language, like the English language, hard?ÿ Why do we spend 12 years in school, just to begin to learn about stuff? I don't know why things are hard.ÿ But to get God's word, and be able to apply it to your life is not exactly easy.ÿ I'll be honest about that.ÿ But the end result is awesome. I'll make the statement I've made before.ÿ And it's true to my experience.ÿ There is not an area of our lives, there is not an experience we go through, that God's word does not address.ÿ That's how much insight is there to be had.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03102.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1994 - Buck McCallum",

"Colossians 2: Vision for the Church - Hearts Knit together in Love",1989-11-05,,"  <h1>Paul wants them to know . . .</h1> So this chapter begins with Paul wanting them to know about his struggles on their behalf.ÿ That is why he went into all that stuff Mark discussed last week... So their hearts may be encouraged.ÿ Paul is thinking of his audience now, and he is thinking, ""I want them to be encouraged by these stories.""ÿ That is why he is writing this letter.ÿ He wants them to be encouraged. And, he says something else he wants.ÿ He wants them to be ""knit together in love.""ÿ This is simply a metaphor for the way he would like to see this community of Christians behave.ÿ Paul is sitting back and thinking of the church at Colossae.ÿ He is thinking of the church at Laodocea.ÿ And he is thinking, ""Yea, I'd like to see those guys living like a church should, knit together in love.""ÿ That's the picture he has in mind as he is writing this letter. <h2>Love = Discernment</h2> Now, when I say that Paul wants the Colossians to be united together in love, that's certainly not surprising.ÿ Haven't we made that point here before?ÿ Yes, I think so. But what comes next is kind of interesting.ÿ Look at what he says love can do.ÿ In the NASB they translate, ""and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding."" <h2>NASB vs. NIV</h2> But, as usual, the translators of the NASB have followed their translation theory to the point of obscurity.ÿ If you don't know the translation theory of the various translations, let me tell you about it.ÿ The NASB translators worked on the belief that the most literal translation of the words, and a one-to-one correspondence with the original syntax would produce the most accurate translation.ÿ So, in other words, when they came to an idiom or complicated syntax, instead of smoothing it over, they left that to you. Well, there are some advantages of that theory.ÿ It is easier to study the words and their usage from the NASB.ÿ But the disadvantage is that it obscures the real meaning of the original sometimes by rendering an unneccearily complex translation.ÿ And this is one of those cases. Example: I've been in Bible study groups before where we read over this kind of verse and just smile. And that's why it is that you will want to consult more than one translation of a passage like this one. Here's how the NIV translates verse 2: My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ. You see, the goal of these translators was clarity first.ÿ So, at times they may take more liberty with the text than the NASB translators.ÿ But often they will be more clear. This is why it is that if you want to really study a passage, then you will read more than one translation.ÿ Don't necessarily lean on one translation for your understanding.ÿ Compare them. <h1>Love gives rise to knowledge</h1> But let's get to the point.ÿ The point Paul is making here is that, somehow, being knit together in love will give rise to what he calls here the ""full riches of complete understanding."" Let me re-phrase the idea.ÿ He is saying that somehow loving one another gives you insight and discernment.ÿ Hmm, I wonder how this is? This, by the way, is not an unusual idea for Paul.ÿ He says the same thing in another book.ÿ In Philippians1:9, 10 Paul says. If you think this is an interesting idea, that love somehow is connected to knowledge, then I agree.ÿ Let me give you a couple ways this is true. <h2>Because Christian love is cognitive</h2> For one, Christian love involves knowledge.ÿ There is a cognitive aspect to Christian love. Example: John talks about this in I John 3:18, where he says that we mustn't love in words only, but in deeds and in truth.ÿ In other words, as I think we all know very well, saying ""I love you"" means nothing, if it's divorced from loving action.ÿ There has to be some weight behind those words. And, he also adds that love needs to consist of truth.ÿ That is to say, there are certain things that are love and certain things that aren't.ÿ And the truth, God's truth, discriminates between them.ÿ Love has be carried on within the confines of knowledge. Or, to say it more positively, knowledge gives us insight into how we can love. Example: Tell me if this isn't a common dilemma.ÿ You see something someone is doing, and you think, ""That's not right.ÿ I wonder if I should mention it?""ÿ And you're puzzled because you really want to know if this is your own gripe, whether you're just being petty, or whether it would really be the loving thing to do to bring this up to the person. I know for some of us, just the idea of thinking about it before we speak up would be a major accomplishment. But that is part of love, being knowledgeable about what is good for people.ÿ When you love someone you want what is best for them.ÿ But what is best for them?ÿ What is good for them?ÿ Isn't that the debate?ÿ Isn't that what we all have differing opinions on? So, we need God's truth on the matter.ÿ And I think that one who intends to get into loving others will become knowledgeable.ÿ The intention to love others demands that we know what is good for them.ÿ That means growing in knowledge. <h2>Because love balances knowledge</h2> But I think love gives rise to knowledge in a different way.ÿ And this may have been more crucial in the case of the Colossians.ÿ Love tempers, balances and corrects knowledge. Real love of other human beings puts all your theories to the test.ÿ A lifestyle of love is the greatest good.ÿ It's what it's all about, as we've made the case in here repeatedly.ÿ And the question is, do the things you think, do the things you believe, still allow you, still encourage and enable you to love other people? Paul is saying this is the litmus test for ideas.ÿ It is the acid test for ideas.ÿ And he can say this because we are human beings.ÿ We are relational.ÿ God created us to be able to love, and to actually thrive on love. Everything we believe has to come to terms with who we are.ÿ Does it help or hinder you from effectively loving other human beings? I say this is probably what Paul is thinking here because he knows these people have been buying into some weird ideas.ÿ He knows they have been indulging some false teaching.ÿ We'll be seeing this more as the chapter goes on.ÿ So, he is saying that they need to pursue this goal of love--being knit together in love.ÿ And that in itself will lead them to a knowledge of what is really true. <h1>The human mind.</h1> You see, when it comes to knowledge, when it comes to things we can think up and support, the human mind is absolutely incredible.ÿ It is possible to think up and support just about any idea you want. And if you don't believe that, just go spend some time at an institution of higher learning.ÿ And if it's a seminary all the better.ÿ You'll find people there who believe everything.ÿ And they have darn good reasons, each in his own little head. Example: I know as I studied a couple years back, people would ask me, ""What do you believe on this or that?""ÿ I could only say, ""I don't know.ÿ I'll have to see.""ÿ Because I realized everything made sense in the fishbowl.ÿ Everything made sense in the vacuum.ÿ I had to see what worked.ÿ I had to see what viewpoint, what perspective actually worked in the relational realm. Example: I used to believe that when people had problems, they either needed a) proper instruction, or b) confrontation.ÿ So, people would come to me, ""Buck, I'm feeling down,"" or ""Buck I've got a problem.""ÿ And I would hear them out, and produce the remedy. I would say that that recipe worked great until I got married.ÿ I don't know how many theories about people and the nature of reality changed from that experience.ÿ But here I was, stuck with a person who didn't want to hear the truth.ÿ Here was a person who didn't want confrontation.ÿ Here was a person who just wanted to be understood.ÿ That's all. Let me tell you, there had been other people who had tried to pull that line on me.ÿ They would get more instruction or confrontation than the rest!ÿ But nobody else could get away with it.ÿ So I was forced to go back to the drawing-board and figure out what I really believed on that issue.ÿ And I began to find that God deals with us in a remarkably different way than I dealt with other people.ÿ He understands us.ÿ He accepts us.ÿ And you know what?ÿ Sometimes that's all! I just remember thinking, ""There's some people I need to apologize to."" There are many issues like that.ÿ There will be more.ÿ My faith, what I believe, is constantly being subject to the interrogation of real-life relationships. And I have to say, as much as I believe in the power of the human mind, it is hopelessly subjective.ÿ I mean, we simply don't have the ability to tell if we have bad breath.ÿ That's the way it is with our thoughts.ÿ They have to come out in the open and be tried in the arena of human relationships.ÿ They have to co-exist with what God tells us about sacrificial love. <h2>Do you subject your beliefs?</h2> Do you subject your beliefs to this test?ÿ Do you look at your life and ask yourself, ""Is there real, meaningful, sacrificial love occurring between me and other humans?"" And when you think about love, think in terms that Paul is saying here, ""Am I knit together in love with someone else?""ÿ Thoughts like this can become such platitudes.ÿ Meaningless phrases that sound nice. Example: Think of the Pledge of Allegiance, ""One nation, under God.""ÿ Is that true?ÿ ""With justice and liberty for all?""ÿ Come on. This is the way it can be for sayings like, ""knit together in love. And remember, it isn't enough to be in a ""loving fellowship.""ÿ It isn't enough to say, ""Yeah, we're knit together in love around here.""ÿ The question is, ""Am I knit together with someone else?""ÿ And get specific, there are measures of whether this is true. Example: Have you had to painfully set aside your pride because you are so close that you butt heads. Example: Are you emotionally affected by anyone. If you don't have these things, that's OK for now.ÿ Just ask this question: What is it about what I believe, what I think I know, that makes me distant from people? There must be some reason you are isolated and don't have that rich quality of relationship. Example: ""I can only love those who won't hurt me."" Example: ""I can only love cool people."" Example: Perhaps it's as simple as the belief that I've got to satisfy my own needs and wants, and then I'll be happy.ÿ There are people right here who believe this. The person who believes that is a lonely and unhappy person.ÿ It's not working! Example: I talked to a guy this week who had lots of relationships with folks.ÿ But in all of them, there was a subtle feeling of tension and alienation.ÿ And he felt like that was OK.ÿ He must have, it had been that way for years! Example: I know another Christian who tried to convince me that people needed to be punished for the wrong they did.ÿ ""When someone wrongs me, there must be retribution of some kind!""ÿ Her favorite thing was to not associate with that person any more.ÿ She was really getting them back, boy!ÿ But you see, anybody who knew her would be able to tell whether what she was saying is true.ÿ Her marriage told you it wasn't working.ÿ Her friendships, or lack thereof, told you it wasn't working.ÿ And the absolute void of love in her life told you it wasn't working. I don't know what you believe.ÿ I don't know what doctrines or theories you hold to.ÿ But if love is deficient in your life, or if biblical love is lacking altogether, then you have to ask yourself, ""What's wrong here?"" <h2>That's what Paul constantly reminded people of</h2> That's what Paul constantly reminded people of.ÿ In the book of Galatians, as he wrote to refute some false teaching they had, he came down to that in the end.ÿ In chapter 5 he takes the whole chapter to make that point.ÿ ""If you bite and devour each other, if you're boastful, challenging each other, what good is your stupid idea?"" And here with the Colossians, he doesn't challenge them that way.ÿ As we've noted before, he doesn't know them personally.ÿ But he does know that if he gives them the vision of being a community, knit together in love, and if they pursue that vision, then they will be that much safer against possible deception and false teaching. <h1>God's Mystery . . .</h1> The next thing Paul sees as a goal is that they would come to a knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ himself. <h2>Mysteries</h2> Now what he is making a veiled reference to here is something that the Colossians liked very much, ""mysteries"".ÿ Mysteries weren't like they are today.ÿ Today, when you think of a mystery you think of an Agatha Christi novel, or something. But a ""mystery"" in Paul's day was a truth that was veiled.ÿ It was a truth that was hard to find.ÿ And yet, to the discoverer of that truth, that one would receive spiritual enlightenment. This was a very popular thing.ÿ And people would do tricks, follow guru types, go through initiations, etc., in order to become enlightened and discover what lay behind the ""mystery."" There were literally hundreds of these mystery religions in the ancient Greek world.ÿ And they were very popular at the time of earliest Christianity.ÿ So, many feel, and there is good evidence to support this, that the source of some of the problems at the church of Colossae was that some of them were buying into these mystery religions.ÿ And they were mixing them with Christianity. So Paul is brining up the ""mystery"" here.ÿ ""Oh boy, you guys wanna know the mystery?""ÿ ""Yea, we wanna know the mystery!""ÿ ""Well get this.ÿ It's not an idea.ÿ It's not a trick.ÿ It's not a way of life.ÿ It's not even some secret information!ÿ It's a person!ÿ It's Jesus Christ!"" <h2>Relationship vs. Philosophy</h2> There is a subtle contrast Paul is bringing up here.ÿ And it is one that would be more evident to his readers.ÿ Paul is telling them that the real scoop is a person.ÿ Christianity is not an idea.ÿ Christianity is not a philosophy.ÿ It is a living relationship with a person. <h3>Not a philosophy</h3> Now when I say it is not a philosophy, I don't mean that Christianity does not deal with the answers.ÿ I'm not saying that it does not dialogue in philosophical terms.ÿ Obviously, being a skeptical and thinking person I believe that Christianity has answers for the questions raised by philosophy. But that is not what it is.ÿ Christianity has answers for us.ÿ But it is not just a system of thought or a point of view. <h3>It is a relationship.</h3> Not a lifestyle or regimen of self-improvement That's the way people think of Christianity. Example: I could read Shirley McLain.ÿ I could join Scandinavian.ÿ Or, I could start going to church! But this is so far from the truth, according to the Bible.ÿ Christianity is a relationship that people need.ÿ In other words, it is not an option.ÿ We need a relationship with God. What's more, if we have this relationship, the other areas will begin to fall into place. &nbsp; &nbsp;",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03105.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1994 - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 2: Competing Voices",1989-11-12,,"  <h1>One route we could take with this teaching is: ""Contrasts with Christ""</h1> <h2>Taken captive to philosphies vs. Christ (v.8)</h2> <h2>Letting people act as judge in matters which are a shadow of Christ (v.ÿ16,ÿ17)</h2> <h2>Taking a stand on your own visions vs. holding fast to Christ (v.ÿ18,ÿ19)</h2> <h2>Submitting to decrees vs. freedom with Christ (v.ÿ20-23)</h2> <h1>But I think we'll take this second route:</h1> <h1>Who are you listening to?</h1> In this passage, which is kind of long, it stretches all the way to the end of this chapter, Paul is addressing the question of who you are listening to.ÿ Because Paul basically sees the world of ideas and loyalties as kind of a competition.ÿ And he knows that Christ, God, is not the only player.ÿ There are countless ideas and values and lifestyles out there competing for our ears. And Paul is going to take some of them on as he goes through this passage. <h1>Things which have appeal</h1> <h2>Philosphies and traditions of men (v.8)</h2> He says first of all, ""See to it that no oneÿ.ÿ.ÿ. "" I think the idea here is that there are many philosophies that are very enticing and they call for people's allegiance.ÿ And Paul is saying that often, they are in direct contradiction to Christ himself. First, I want to clarify the reason Paul is so down on philosophy and what he calls here, ""empty deception."" The reason is that philosophy is inadequate to address the questions they were dealing with. The questions they were addressing were not whether or not there was a God.ÿ Or, whether or not there is such a thing as morality.ÿ They already believed all that.ÿ The questions they were now addressing were ""How should I live my life?"" and ""What are the various moral standards I should have?"" And there is a real problem with philosophy when we try to address these more specific questions.ÿ It has to do with what we discussed last week.ÿ Our minds are so nimble and adept at backing things up, we are more likely to arrive at something we prefer than something that is actually true. The legitimate task of philosophy is to probe the issues of whether there is a God or not.ÿ And to ask questions about our origins.ÿ Of course, philosophy is also concerned with analyzing how we think and communicate. So, the point of philosophical speculation is to address some of the basic, more general questions.ÿ And I think we can go quite far on these kinds of issues.ÿ For example, we can talk about whether a God exists.ÿ We can use arguments like the ""causal argument""ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But, even if we arrive at the fact that there is a God, that still doesn't tell us what kind of a God he is.ÿ It doesn't tell us what he has in mind for us.ÿ It doesn't tell us a lot of the real practical issues that we wonder about. So, philosophy is incompetant to deal with the practical, day to day stuff.ÿ You might think, ""What else is there?ÿ If philosophy doesn't deal with the question of morality, what is beautiful, etc., then what does?!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you were going to take a class on ethics down at OSU, what department would handle it?ÿ The philosophy department!ÿ Even if it is in the business department, usually a philosophy professor will handle it.ÿ If you were going to discuss what is beautiful, or what is meaningfulÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And yet, here we are saying that, actually, philosophy is not competant to handle those questions. And the reason? Paul, in this passage, actually gives us some insight as to why this is.ÿ He points out that, when it comes to how to live, all we really have to go on are what he calls here the ""tradition of men and the elementary principles of this world.""ÿ That's what really guides our thinking in these matters. And the tradition of men, and the elementary principles of this world are woeful standards to go by--just terrible. <h3>Everybody is a philosopher</h3> Let me point out, before we get much further here, everybody is a philosopher.ÿ Everybody has a philosophy, or combination of them, that he lives by.ÿ And this fact is true, whether we realize it or not! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Consider the man who says, ""I'm no philosopher!ÿ Philosophy is for sissies!""ÿ Well, the philosophy that this man holds is evident from what he is saying: ""Brute force, or strength, or deeds, is the greatest value!""ÿ ""The one who is strongest is best.""ÿ ""The one who does, is greatest.""ÿ And that is a philosophy! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Consider the guy who says, ""I'm no philosopher!ÿ Philosophy is for people who can't hack the real world!""ÿ Once again, that man has a philosophy.ÿ And it is something like this: ""The greatest good is to go out and conquer or excell in the world of business, or the world of sports,"" or whatever this guy considers to be the ""real world.""ÿ That is a philosophy. And the problem with all these philosophies is just what Paul says, they rest on the shakey, completely unfounded grounding of the ""tradition of men."" <h3>Traditions of men</h3> When he says ""tradition of men,"" he is refering to just the standard way people think.ÿ These are the values and judgments that humans have always had.ÿ And they include such things as brute force, the ability to deceive, the ability to seduce, and things like these. I hope you realize, in our world, values and ideals come, not from what is right and good and beneficial to all.ÿ Values come from whoever is strongest, whoever wins, whoever has the money to promote them. <h4>They seem altruistic</h4> Now, on the one hand, when it comes to living my life, we could say that the traditions of men are also things like justice, mercy, opportunity and love.ÿ Right?ÿ Isn't this what we would tend to think? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If we were to pass out a survey right now, and ask, ""What values do you think are the greatest?"" We would definitely get an answer like thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h4>But the truth isÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h4> But, that's not the issue.ÿ The issue is, ""What do I do when it come down to it?ÿ What do I chose to do when the question of some moral dilemma comes up?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here I am running a store, and the competition is losing because my deals have been pretty irrisistable.ÿ And it's not just my deals either, my advertising and marketing strategy has been making him look pretty silly.ÿ Well, things get so bad at one point that it will come down to this other guy going out of business and losing his house and home!ÿ Do you think at that point I would opt for the value of mercy or justice?ÿ Heck no!ÿ That's the whole goal of what I've been doing! In this case, as in many, the personal value of greed wins out over the hyper-idealistic value of mercy.ÿ And we could tell hundreds of stories like this. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: On an individual basis, here I am in love with some girl, we're dating, and then along comes this other girl, who is better looking and has lots of other qualities too.ÿ At that time, do you think I would opt for the idealistic values of ""faithfulness"" and ""honesty""?ÿ Heck no! I'll go for the personal values of enjoyment and something better for me! And that's the way we are with thing after thing.ÿ The tradition of men is <strong>self first</strong>. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You want to know what I hate?ÿ I'll tell you what I really hate.ÿ It's when a movie star, or some celebrity comes along and says, ""I want to give $5,000 to the homeless!ÿ And I want to have them all over to my house for dinner!ÿ But the fact is, he just made $30,000,000 that year alone!ÿ What is really being said here?ÿ What is really being said here is, ""I love my money!ÿ I will not part with it.ÿ But I will, out of guilt or whatever, throw a few pennies to the needy."" But the rest of us buy it!ÿ We think that's the way we really are.ÿ ""Buck!ÿ Didn't you see `Hands Accross America!?'ÿ Didn't you see `Live Aid!?'"" No, it's not the way we really are, and I think we will be better off if we face it.ÿ Each one of us lives on the principle of ""self first.""ÿ And we are willing to defend that principle, even if we have to murder. And if you don't really believe that, it may be because you just haven't had it tested yet. <h3>Elementary principles of the world</h3> It's the same idea with the ""elementary principles of the world.""ÿ Things like greed, violence, and the abuse of power are the real things that make the world tick. <h3>The need for revelation</h3> That's why it is, then, that the Bible insists that we can't trust our intuition, our philosophy, or anything that originates from our own selves.ÿ Because we come up with notions that please our own selves. So, when it comes to living life, how to find fulfillment, how to get along with people, what values to have, any of the particulars, Paul is saying we need to turn to Christ.ÿ That is, we need to turn to God himself--as it says in the next verse: ""In Him, the fullness of diety dwellsÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Jesus said, ""I came to give people life!ÿ And I came to give it to them more abundantly than they've ever had it before."" In another place he said, ""If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and I will satisfy.""ÿ He is saying that we have needs, he knows how to take care of them.ÿ He is saying that we have pains, he is willing to take care of them. <h3>We listen to everything else</h3> But let me tell you what the problem is: The problem is that we will listen to everything else.ÿ We will listen to anything else but Jesus Christ, who is God himself. I know how it is.ÿ I know just how willing we are to listen to things.ÿ We will listen to the ideas of some completely screwed up rock singer--who's life is a mess, who can't even hold on to one friendship, who would lose his whole identity if he wasn't popular and rich--we will listen to that mere human before we will listen to Christ!ÿ I know, I've done it! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Before I decided to get into Christ, one of the groups that was kind of popular was BTO.ÿ And they had the song, ""Taking Care of Business.""ÿ It was about how everybody fretted about for nothing.ÿ And he was set because he was self-employed and hardly had to work. ÿI thought, ""Yeah!ÿ That's it!ÿ What am I doing working so hard?""ÿ And I decided to make money from selling drugs and stolen goods, anything that was easy! ""These guys must know what they're talking about, they're on the radio!"" We will listen to teachers, who again, are merely human.ÿ We will listen to our parents, and the values they impressed on us.ÿ Some of them may be good, but who is to say?ÿ We're talking about one human's opinion against another. And Paul is saying, ""Isn't it about time we started to listen to Christ, who is the fulness of diety in bodily form?"" <h2>Religious rituals (v.ÿ16, 17)</h2> Paul goes on to another thing that was very attractive in v.ÿ16.ÿ He says, ""Let no one act as your judge in respect toÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Here it appears they latched onto the religious rituals prescribed in the Old Testament.ÿ And if you are not familiar with these, I can't familiarize you now.ÿ Because there are about 600 of them.ÿ What they were, in short, were a bunch of rituals and laws that God gave the people of Israel.ÿ But they had an instructive purpose.ÿ They were designed to teach the people that one day, God would come in person and remove the sins of the world. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: One of them was the killing of a lambÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So Paul says these things are only shadows of Christ himself.ÿ They pre-figured J.C.ÿ But now that he has come, they actually stand in competition with him. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It would be like falling in love with the preview to a movie, and feeling like you never needed to go to the actual movie because the preview is so awesome.ÿ A movie producer, not to mention the financial backers, would be pretty put out if everyone decided that the little teaser they put out was so great that nobody went to the movie. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It would be like those teasers they put at the beginning of A Current Affair, ""Nude Dancers Arrested in Florida""ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I'm not so sure this is a big problem today, so we won't dwell on it. <h2>Personal visions (v.ÿ18)</h2> Look at the third competing voice is in v.ÿ18.ÿ He says that they get into self-abasement and the worship of angels.ÿ But note where they are getting their ideas from: their own visions. This is a real popular means of religious knowledge.ÿ Always has been, and still is today.ÿ People feel like some kind of experience, where you have a vision or hear a voice, has got to be the best way to find God. And yet Paul is saying that this is the most shakey kind of ground to stand on.ÿ He says that to take a stand on visions and feelings we have gotten in our own heads is to be inflated without cause by a fleshly mind! What's weird about this whole idea of seeing a vision, or feeling like God told me something.ÿ Ironically, many people will feel more sure about this than anything else!ÿ It's like, ""If God told me, then it must be true!ÿ God told me!"" And when someone else is saying, ""God told meÿ.ÿ.ÿ.,"" you have an instinctive reaction, ""Oh, well, I guess I'd better not question that!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've had this line pulled on me in arguments before!ÿ What am I supposed to say?!ÿ ""Well, God's wrong!"" I guess I just don't know how we can be so confident about that kind of stuff. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How do I know that what I am sensing is, in fact, God?ÿ Or is it my own greed?ÿ Or my pride talking? And then you ask people that question, ""Well, I just know!"" That's why I think Paul says that people who take their stands on visions they have seen are inflated in their own egos.ÿ It amounts to a confidence in the self that we could only call an inflated ego. The alternative, is to do what Paul says here, ""Hold fast to the head.""ÿ What he is refering to is the notion that Christ is the head, and we are the body.ÿ In other words, we should take our direction from Christ himself.ÿ And fortunately, the words of Christ, and the life of Christ, is recorded for us in the Scripturesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Prohibitions (v.ÿ21)</h2> Then, finally, these Colossians were listening to a message that has been known for centuries to be totally effective: guilt manipulation.ÿ Some folks were coming out with prohibitions like, ""Don't eat this stuff, and don't touch the other."" I guarantee you.ÿ If you want to start a sucessful religion, then just come up with a list of the 10 most deadly and harmful things you can do.ÿ ""10 things to avoid at all costs, and then you will be OK."" This has instant appeal to human beings.ÿ Look what Paul says, ""Indeed, these have the appearance of wisdom!""ÿ And the reason they have the appearance of wisdom is because of a little thing we have: a guilty conscience.ÿ Everybody has it.ÿ And if you come along and say, ""This and this and this is baaaadd!""ÿ You will instantly strike a resonant chord in people's hearts! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: See, I don't know if you guys have been acustomed to listening to this kind of message.ÿ Chances are, you probably haven't.ÿ But when guilt-manipulating preachers come on, telling you to burn your rock-records, and this kind of stuff, it's real persuasive.ÿ It strikes a resonant chord with me!ÿ Why?ÿ Because I know I'm bad.ÿ I know I've got all kinds of problems.ÿ And when someone comes along and says, ""It's because you do this!"" it makes sense. I think the ""do not taste, do not touch"" stuff has real apeal for a couple of reasons: <h3>Simple</h3> For one, it sounds kind of simple.ÿ If you come along and say, ""The problem is the seductive message of rock albums,"" then the simple solution is to burn them! And if you want to get a little more complex, and say, ""The problem is the food you eat!"" then you can fix that too! But unfortunatley, our problem is not that simple.ÿ I've been there, in churches where these were the standard solutions to sin.ÿ And let me tell you something as an insider: It doesn't work. Isn't that what Paul says here? (v.ÿ23) The stories I could tell you, they would be totally amazing.ÿ Fortunately, I don't have to go any further than the headlines to show this kind of thing! (I don't have to expose anyone who isn't already exposed.) <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here was one preacher recently, who taught with a vengance (I've heard him), on the evils of rock-music.ÿ Why?ÿ Because they have dirty lyrics, on occassion.ÿ At other times they encourage rebellion, and these kinds of things.ÿ But, at the same time, this very preacher, was hiring a prostitute, having her perform lude acts, and masturbating in front of her while he verbally abused her!ÿ All this, and he never listened to rock and roll! Well, we shouldn't really be surprised.ÿ Because the problem is not the things we eat, or listen to.ÿ The problem is with us.ÿ The answer of the guilt manipulators, that the problem is with this thing or that thing, is a failureÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>Absolves us of responsibility</h3> And along those same lines, the implication of these prohibitions is that the problem is with those substances.ÿ And that is what Paul is saying here when he points out that there is nothing with the substances themselves. The problem is with us!ÿ We are the ones who have a moral problem. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There's nothing wrong with foods.ÿ The problem is that we are so greedy that we turn into gluttons. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: For a controversial issue, there is nothing wrong with drugs, or alcohol, in themselves.ÿ The problem is that when we consume them, our thought-life is completely out of control.ÿ Our emotions get out of control.ÿ And often, our behavior gets completely out of control.ÿ And what happens when any of these things gets out of control?ÿ Terrible things! So it is, then, that the problem is with us.ÿ And the solution is, once again, Christ.ÿ Jesus Christ offers to forgiveÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The problem is, that guilty conscience doesn't come from the things we eat, touch, or handle.ÿ It comes from the way we areÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03106.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1994 - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 3: The Hidden New Life",1989-11-19,,"  Last week, we talked about the different competing ideas and philosophies that present alternatives to God's way.ÿ And, at the bottom of it all, Paul says, ""They just don't work."" That's how he rounds out chapter two (read v.ÿ23).ÿ He was talking about the religious folks, and he says, ""What they have to say has the appearance of wisdom, unfortunately, it doesn't work!"" To be specific, these various alternatives to God don't work when it comes to changing people.ÿ Think about what it means to actually change people.ÿ When you look today at our culture, you might think that people are getting better, right? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: After all, we are now the richest country in the world.ÿ And now, people have ? On the other hand, by a lot of measures, we aren't getting better at all. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Consider the measure of mental healthÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Consider the measure of family hapinessÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Consider the measure of violence and crimeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The consistent thing about all these measures is that they have to do with how people are doing.ÿ Other measures, like the increase in techology, the economny, etc., are measures of <strong>things</strong>. So, in spite of our great learning, in spite of our progress in many areas, we still have to admit, it is hard to change people. <h2>What does work?</h2> And this is what Paul turns to next.ÿ He is turning to the question of what does work.ÿ What changes people? <h1>So theoretical!</h1> Read 1-4 Isn't it amazing how he starts here?ÿ Think about this.ÿ If you were going to tell someone how to change, where would you start?ÿ This is just average advice for people.ÿ What would you say? I think I would begin by telling people the kinds of things they needed to do in order to see change in their life.ÿ In fact, I know this is what I would do. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If someone came to me, and said, ""Give me a general blueprint for change,"" I would say something like this: ""Well, you need to get in with the right people.ÿ You need to start praying.ÿ You need to start searching the Scriptures for what God has to say to youÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" And all of that is true!ÿ But Paul, the apostle and largely the founder of Christianity, doesn't do that.ÿ Where is starts is here with all this vague, etherial stuff about being raised with Christ, seeking the things aboveÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The thing that bothers me about this kind of language is that it doesn't seem realistic!ÿ I get the feeling that I don't know what Paul is talking about.ÿ Now, I know that some people don't agree with me at all about this.ÿ They have an instant attraction to this kind of language. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember one guy that I used to talk to a lot about spiritual growth.ÿ When I would have a question, I would often come and bounce it off him.ÿ My questions were questions about every day things, like, ""How do you deal with drugs?"" and ""How do you get into the Lord when you don't feel like it?""ÿ And his answers would be like this: ""You need to focus on who you are in Christ!ÿ You need to see that you have been raised with Christ.ÿ You are a new person!"" And that kind of answer puzzled me no end.ÿ I don't sense any newness here.ÿ I don't see any new person in the area.ÿ How can you say that I'm a new personÿ.ÿ.ÿ.? So, some peole, when they see sayings like this, say, ""Aah, yes!ÿ Focus on the things above!""ÿ And they have instant attraction to this picture. But others have a feeling of confusion when they see things like these. What I want to point out is that the more theoretical, etherial picture that Paul has in mind here has very practical elements.ÿ And he gets into those.ÿ But, at the same time, those practical elements would not work or make sense apart from the foundation that Paul lays here in the first four verses. <h2>The big picture isÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Let's think about what the big picture isÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Paul says there are a couple things which are true about us.ÿ He says that we have been raised with Christ. <h3>Since you have been raised with Christÿ.ÿ.ÿ. you have died</h3> What he is saying here is that he Christian has a new life.ÿ Just as Christ was raised from the dead after his crucifixion, the Christian has a new life available to him. He is saying roughly the same thing when he says that our old life has passed away.ÿ Our old life is finished from God's perspective. But even as I say these things, I realize that they are kind of unclear.ÿ What do I mean when I say, ""New life?""ÿ What do I mean when I say, ""our old life is finished?"" <h2>Our life is hidden</h2> And the reason this terminology is so hard to understand or envision, Paul says right here in this passage:ÿ He says, ""this new life is hidden with Christ in God.""ÿ That is to say, it is obscured.ÿ When something is hiddenÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, the fact is, the new life God has for us is actually kind of a secret. And the next thing he says here is that it will be revealed later, when Christ comes again.ÿ So, the picture is this: We have a new life.ÿ Paul says it's ours.ÿ But, it is hidden and will be revealed when Christ comes again. <h1>All the good things God has for us</h1> This is a consistent picture we see in the Bible.ÿ God has a life for us, which we call ""heaven,"" or the ""afterlife.""ÿ And this life is beyond our wildest expectations. The Bible portrays heaven as a place which is so awesome, it is virtually indescribable.ÿ It uses metaphors of beauty, happiness and prosperity to try and communicate what it is like.ÿ But clearly, it is so different and great, that it is very hard to explain. We know in heaven that there will be perfect love between people (IÿCor.ÿ13). We know that there will be responsibilities (Lukeÿ19). We know that there will be good times and things to be enjoyed. But just how all these things fit together, we don't know.ÿ We only know that it is so great, that Jesus, for example, said that to be part of it is worth selling everything you have. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: He tells the story of finding a pearlÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ If only you know how great it is, you would sell everything you had to have it. <h2>But it is free!</h2> But you know, as a fascinating point here, the Bible tells us that even though the afterlife is beyond imagination and priceless, God offers it to us for free. People have a hard time with this, because the feeling is that nothing is for free, especially good stuff like eternal life.ÿ But God's point of view is that there is no price you could assign to it.ÿ It is, literally, priceless. And, also from his point of view, to assign a price would be sheer insult.ÿ Because God is offering the afterlife to us at the price of his own life.ÿ Eternal life and heaven is not something that we somehow deserve.ÿ God tells us that if we deserve anything, it's judgment. I think people feel like after a rough life on this earth, somehow they deserve to be rewarded by bliss in the afterlife--especially if they kind of tried to be nice while they were here.ÿ And God's position is, ""No way.""ÿ If humans deserve anything, it is to be judged for the way we've ignored God and screwed up this world. And this is why God came in the person of JCÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, now he offers us forgiveness and eternal life as a free gift. <h2>What now?</h2> But, back to our passage, here is all this new life God has in store for us.ÿ And it is so greatÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But the question is, what about now?ÿ What of this new life do we have now?ÿ And that is where a passage like this one is so important.ÿ Because the whole Bible is clear that we have an amazing life awaiting us when Christ returns.ÿ But here, this passage tells us that the life God has waiting for us is actually something we should seek right now.ÿ That's what he means when he says, ""Seek the things above.""ÿ It means, seek the things that are coming to you.ÿ Seek the next life now. As we noted previously, this language seems to be kind of etherial.ÿ It seems to be talking about the kinds of things you ought to be thinking about. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In fact, I remember once this passage was taught to me that way.ÿ The point was being made that our thought-life was key to our spiritual growth.ÿ So, if you were going to grow, then you need to ""set your mind on the things above.""ÿ Well, naturally, someone in the group asked, ""What are you supposed to think about?ÿ What are the `things above' that I'm supposed to think about?""ÿ And the answer was, ""A good thought life would be thinking about things like sitting on God's lap, looking into his face for all eternity."" An admirable thought, but not very competitive in the world of imagesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is not just talking about what your thought life should be like.ÿ This passage is talking about what we should desire in life.ÿ It is talking about what we should want in life.ÿ ""I want the life God has for me."" <h2>Set your mind onÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> And when he says, ""Set your mind on the things above,"" he is saying, ""long for the life God has for you."" And the point is, that new life is available now, to those who really want it.ÿ It is hidden.ÿ It is a mystery, but it can be found.ÿ It can be discovered by those who really want it.ÿ If you seek it.ÿ If you want it.ÿ If that is where your mind is at, you can get the beginning of what God has in store for you. And this is real important for those of us who are Christians and thinking about the Christian life and what God has in store for us.ÿ Because if there is one things Christians are concerned about, it's this right here.ÿ What does God have for me? What we're seeing is that it is a mystery.ÿ It is hidden, and is only revealed to those who unreservedly, completely want it.ÿ This is faith.ÿ Faith is where you don't know exactly what God has for you, but you say, ""I want it anyway."" <h2>Lots of Christians play gamesÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Just to contrast this attitude of faith, what we see so often out of Christians is an attitude of testing God.ÿ Instead of unreservedly, completely setting their mind on what he has for them, they test him, the experiment with him. There are a lot of people who have a kind of bargaining posture with God.ÿ They feel like, ""If God lets me do this or that, then it's OK.ÿ But if not, then I'm not sure I'm interested."" Other people have fears.ÿ ""If God makes me do this or that, then I'm not sure."" And this is the approach so many Christians have to God.ÿ But the Bible is very clear, without faith in God--a faith which says, ""Whatever you have for me, I want it, I've got to have it--without that, the life God has for you will remain hidden. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Sometimes when I'm going somewhere with someone, I'll play a little game.ÿ As we get in the car, they'll say, ""Where are we going?""ÿ And I'll say, ""Let's just go this way for a whileÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ And, depending on the person, they just get so uncomfortable!ÿ ""What do you mean, `this way?!'ÿ Where are we going?"" They want to know where I'm taking them, so that they can see if they agree or not. ÿThey want control too.ÿ Well, it's one thing to demand I come out with my plans so that they can see if they agree.ÿ It's quite another to be that way with God.ÿ Because, when you're that way with God, that is the very essence of sin. The essence of sin before God is to say, ""I want to be in control.ÿ I want to have the final say in my life.""ÿ It is to virtually take the place of God in our lives.ÿ It is for this very attitude that Jesus came and died! It will never work to have more than one God in our life.ÿ Never.ÿ So, God says, ""You can trust me to be God.ÿ Give me your life.ÿ Seek what I have to offer.ÿ Or, you can pursue your own life, in which case the life I have will remain a mystery!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How many people have I had now ask me in one way or another, ""How come, in my Christian life, I've never seen God really work?ÿ How come I've never seen him really change me, like some of the rest of you say you have?""ÿ Let me suggest this: Most likely, <strong>it is because you don't want it.</strong> That comes as such a surprise to people.ÿ They feel like they do want what God wants.ÿ Really?ÿ Really?ÿ Think about it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Falling into my Dads' armsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. That's what we're talking about here.ÿ Are you willing to say to God, ""OK, whatever you have for me!""ÿ And then, back it up with our actions?",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03107.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1994 - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 3: Leaving the Old Life: Where Change Begins",1989-12-03,,"  <h1>Seeking God</h1> <h2>An extreme attitude</h2> Last week we talked about an attitude which is absolutely essential to growth and change in the Christian life: seeking God.ÿ Paul conveyed this attitude in terms of ""seeking the things above"" and ""setting your mind on the things God has for you."" When we seek God, it has to be virtually an obsession.ÿ He is found when we really want him.ÿ Some people would say, ""Yeah, I seek God.""ÿ But in reality, all they do is show up at church now and then or say a prayer before meals.ÿ That's not seeking God.ÿ That's called tipping your hat to the old fellerÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>God's life remains a mystery</h2> Paul went further with this.ÿ He said that the reason it is so important to seek God is that your life is hidden away (v.ÿ4).ÿ In other words, God has a life for us, he has a will for us, but we have to seek it out in order to find it.ÿ We said that when, and only when, you set your mind on God's will for you, then you will start to see what it is. In other words, when we decide that we want his way in our lives, and we want it so bad that we are virtually fixated on it, like Paul says here, then we will begin to get some insight into what he has for us.ÿ But until that time, as Paul says here, God's ideal for your life remains a mystery!ÿ It remains hidden. As we pointed out last week, God has a life for you, a life that is beyond what you can imagine.ÿ And with each of us, God's life takes a unique shape.ÿ Each of us is different, and God has different things he can do with us. We see this time and again with people--turning into things that you never would have imaginedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I look at my own life and can't believe what God has done.ÿ How can I take credit for what he has done?ÿ Here is a guy who used to sit for 9, 10, more hours on end and just listen to music!ÿ If it were up to me, I would be one of those guys who just sits around and watches TV all day, and then wonders where he can find some food.ÿ But God has come into my life and given me so much. And I'm not alone.ÿ I could tell story after story of people here who God has really changedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. See, with God, change really is possible. ÿWe talked about how it is not happening in the world around us.ÿ But with God, it is happeningÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Seeking = relinquishing control</h2> But, in order for God to come an unlock what is stored there, he requires that we really seek him.ÿ This kind of total seeking we discussed last weekÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And we said last week that the reason God waits for us to have this attitude of seeking is because there is a conflict between God and us.ÿ This is the very nub of the issue between mankind and God.ÿ Humans want to run their own lives, and be gods of their own lives, but God says that is his place. So, his position is simply this: If you want to be god in your life, then fine.ÿ Have things your way.ÿ In that case things will be your way and not God's way.ÿ But if you want God to have his way in your life, then let him be God and not you.ÿ That is the simple choice before us. And this is where vs. 5 picks upÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>Put to death your sinsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> I like the way the NIV says it better: Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatryÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>The same idea, in the negative</h2> When he starts out here, ""put to death,"" he is using very graphic imagery to say essentially, ""give up"" or ""relinquish control"" of the way you lived your life.ÿ This is basically the same idea as completely fixing your mind on God and what he wants, but in the negative.ÿ Now he is saying, ""Totally let go of your old way of life."" And that is the choice before us.ÿ We can say, ""I want to run my life my way.""ÿ In which case, certain things will typify our lives.ÿ Or, we can do what he is suggesting here and turn our life over to God.ÿ That what this extreme language is all about. I know that one of the questions that came up last week was that it seems very extreme.ÿ It's like, either you live God's way or you live your way, and there's no middle ground.ÿ Is that the way it really is? And the answer is, in one sense, yes.ÿ In our attitude, in our focus, we are either turning our life over to God or not.ÿ What I'm talking about here is the general direction of your life.ÿ And that's why Paul uses such extreme language, like, ""Put to death the old way of life."" On the other hand, the Bible recognizes that change does not happen all at once.ÿ Change is a gradual thing.ÿ And so, even though the general direction of my life is toward God, from day to day, I may do many things that aren't his will at all. As you go on in your Christian life, you get more and more sensitive to this reality.ÿ ""Even though I'm going for God, and I want his way in my life, I stray from that every day in many ways."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I can tell you honestly that I don't know if I could even keep track of how many times I sin in one day!ÿ I would go nuts trying. But often young Christians or even non-Christians don't understand that.ÿ They think that to start going for God means that everything in my life changes right away.ÿ My attitudes change.ÿ My language changes.ÿ My thought life changes--<strong>all right now!</strong> I think that one thing that assumes is that our problems are fairly shallow and easy to deal with--as if they could be dealt with today, or tommorow, or even next year! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I don't know if I get this more than most folks or not because I'm a public speaker.ÿ But other Christians tell me they run into this all the time too.ÿ Here I'll be sitting around with some folks, and I'll sin with my mouth.ÿ Or I'll sin in my actions somehow.ÿ And people will approach me later, sometimes real serious, ""Don't you think that was a sin?""ÿ And I'll say, ""Well, yeah.""ÿ And then the look on their face is like, ""Well, then why did you do it?"" I'll tell you what my constant reaction is, whether I say it or not.ÿ ""If only you knew the truth!ÿ You wouldn't be shocked by what you heard or saw if only you knew the real truth!"" And this is the way for all of us.ÿ We look at others and say, ""Well, if he is following God, how could he do that?""ÿ But let me tell you, if just for one day, just one day, our thought life could be projected up on that screen for everyone to see.ÿ We would never have the nerve to ask that question anymore. <h2>Gospel</h2> This has got to be, by the way, one of the strongest testimonies for God's love for us.ÿ People think it's so terrible for non-Christians to see Christians sin.ÿ ""Oh, if they see us sin, then they'll think we're no different than they are and they won't want to be Christians!"" That's hogwash.ÿ You know what keeps people from becoming Christians?ÿ It's not that they feel like we aren't righteous.ÿ Although some feel like we're hypocritesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. It's that they feel like they can't change and become righteous, like they know Christians are supposed to be!ÿ So they feel like they should just steer clear of things till they're ready to get righteouss. And that image is aided and fostered by many Christians who believe they need to hide their sins and weaknesses. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was talking to one guy about going to bars.ÿ And he said he was afraid of going to a bar with a non-Xian because then the non-Christian would see that he lusted.ÿ So, I asked, ""Do you lust?'ÿ He said yeah, but he wouldn't want him to know that.ÿ Why?!ÿ How will it hurt?ÿ I told him that non-Christian will either see right through himÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Or, he will believe him and think that's what it means to be a Christian! I told him what I've told many, and I'll tell you, Be honest!ÿ Be honest! People need to know, it's not that we're good people.ÿ It's that we're forgiven people.ÿ They need to know God is changing us, but So, even though the language here is so strong--""consider yourself deadÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""--God's plan for change is not overnight.ÿ It takes time.ÿ And the more we go on with the Lord, the more we see that change is a very sizeable job. <h1>Worth letting go</h1> Then Paul goes on to this list of stuff that typifies life apart from God. I think Paul's first point, as he lists these characteristics of our life without God is that it is truly worth letting go of.ÿ He mentions here a list of some things that are not too great (read). <h2>Our images are false and naive</h2> As you read a list of stuff like this, you might be tempted to think that some of these things aren't so bad.ÿ But the reason this is is because our image of things is actually quite different from reality. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here last night I was talking with a friend of mine about fishing.ÿ And this is the cold time of year when you start thinking about fishingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And this is the way it is with our image of things.ÿ These things right here are often images we are quite confused about. <h2>We were enslaved to them</h2> For one, when it says that we were into these things, we need to remember how.ÿ Because here it says we were into things like ""greed.""ÿ Well, that's not so bad, is it?ÿ Worse things could happen. <h3>Greed</h3> But that's only half the picture.ÿ The fact is, we get into something like greed, which means a lust for more, more anything.ÿ And we are not satisfied!ÿ In other words, it's not that I'm greedy and I get my sense of greed fufilled.ÿ The fact is, that greed always possesses me.ÿ Along with the desire, I get a profound sense of hollowness. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I think of fishermen when this picture comes up.ÿ I hang around various people who like to fish.ÿ And nothing will stimulate fish greed more than a successful fishing trip.ÿ You might think that a fisherman would be satisfied once he has gotten a rasher of big ones.ÿ But no!ÿ Now he's not satisfied with anything less!ÿ Next time it has to be more and bigger ones!ÿ And it goes on. Well, the same thing happens in the realm of money, things, sports, popularity, etc.ÿ This is the stuff that drives some people to vice.ÿ And it drives others to severe shallowness. <h3>Passion</h3> And you think, ""passion, that's not so bad.ÿ Everybody needs passion, even the president needs passion.""ÿ But I don't think he is exactly communicating a positive message here.ÿ What he is refering to is the sad state where someone's urges, someone's emotional cravings run their life. And once again, this is something that is so true.ÿ I look out, and I see this.ÿ I saw it in my own life.ÿ Either we will become obsessed with various urges, thinking about them and longing for them.ÿ Which inevitably leads to a serious frustration.ÿ Or, we supress those urges and drives and focus on something else.ÿ In either case, we are being run by our passions.ÿ Our attitude and behavior is being controlled by our emotional cravings. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I used to paint with a guy I named ""Dave Dog,"" because he was like a hound.ÿ (He didn't mind the name in the slightest.)ÿ Every woman we passed he drooled over.ÿ Every other idea out of his mouth had to do with women.ÿ And it's not like this really irritated me that much.ÿ What it was is just a profound picture of how hungry people really are. So, what I'm saying here is that the real thing is completely different from our images.ÿ If Hollywood made a real movie, following someone through a day, capturing all his thoughts and feelings, it would be a flop.ÿ No one would want to face the real thing.ÿ We don't allow ourselves to truly evaluate the moment-to-moment reality of our lives, much less watch it on screen.ÿ So, Hollywood reproduces our images.ÿ The more a show fits our image, and reinforces taht, the more we like it. But let me tell you, if you are so naive as to think that your images of life and yourself are actually true, you will have a rude awakening some day.ÿ I don't know when it will be.ÿ But the more you cling to the shallow picture of your images, the more rude it will be. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In Blanky's teaching last week she talked about a human who reasons like a beast.ÿ This is what it is--to think that the piece of grass you're eating is really where it's at. In fact, for many, as they get on to middle age, they can't handle the discrpancy between what they have always thought about themselves and the meaning of life and what they are actually seeing. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This is what they call a middle-age crisis.ÿ It's when you wake up and start to wonder, ""What am I really?ÿ What is my life about?""ÿ And for some folks, this is so traumatic that they have nervous breakdownsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So the old way is something that Paul says we have been freed from.ÿ That does not mean that we are, in fact, completely delivered.ÿ Rather, what Paul means is that we have the potential for freedom in these areas.ÿ What remains is the process of working through some of the character flaws and problems in our life and actually gaining victory.ÿ This is a life-long process that he turns to next. <h1>Areas to start changing</h1> Paul is telling us where to start changing.ÿ If you noticed, you'll see that all these things are things you do with other people.ÿ You get angry at someone elseÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Paul is laying down some real insight here.ÿ God begins his work of changing people in the area of how we get along with other people.ÿ This isn't always the case. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some self-help programs say you have to begin by treating yourself better.ÿ Some will tell you that you need to get treated better by others. But here, Paul is saying that God's way is to begin changing the way you interact with others. <h2>We are failures at relationships</h2> I said that we fail at relationships.ÿ And I know that sometimes we don't like to accept that. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here he talks about anger, malice, and slander.ÿ But when you look at the Coors commercial, and the guy is sliding through the room, everything is happy, everyone is a friend.ÿ Boy, don't they wish it was really that way.ÿ But it ain't that way.ÿ I don't know any place where it's that way.ÿ What I see are broken relationships.ÿ Anger.ÿ Bitterness.ÿ Failure.ÿ We leave people behind and try to move on to other, more happy people.ÿ Till we leave them behind.ÿ Or, perhaps we settle down to a relationship that is cold and lifeless, but at least it doesn't bite. God is saying that he starts by changing that.ÿ And it's fulfilling relationships that people want, more that anything else. <h2>The others were just a ruse</h2> And really, when you think of it, these other things that we get into, they are really just a ruse, a hollow replacement for what we really want: fulfilling relationships with other people.ÿ Deep down, that's what people really long for.ÿ But they can't do it, so they turn to other things. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Do you really think that someone like ""Dave Dog"" was happy?ÿ Do you really think that people who jump from one bed to another are really getting what they want?ÿ Not at all.ÿ What they would really like, if they could have it, would be fulfilling, close relationships.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03108.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1994 - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 3: God's Love",1989-12-10,,"  <h1>People have significance in relation to Christ</h1> <h2>Last week: the negative</h2> Last week we talked about the things that characterized our life apart from God.ÿ And some of those things were kind of negative.ÿ Paul says to ""put them all aside.""ÿ And ""consider yourself dead to them.""ÿ These were phrases which said, ""Make a choice.ÿ Are you going to be into these things or are you going to turn your life over to God."" Let's now look into what it is all about to turn your life over to God. <h2>Relational equality</h2> I said last week that where things start is in our relationships.ÿ When you look at the list of things that God would like to change in v.8, 9, they all have to do with relationships. Paul goes on and says, ""Put on your new self.""ÿ He is saying that there is a new life you can take up.ÿ You don't just lay aside the old one, you take up the new one--a life that is intensely relational. As Paul starts to explain how relationships in the Lord ought to work, one thing he sees as imperative is that we lay aside the distinctions and barriers that so characterize relationships elsewhere. When we talk about distinctions, we are talking about something that is absolutely assumed and basic in the world around us.ÿ Everybody is part of a group.ÿ The whole thing in the world is being part of a group. In fact, in your come-off to other people it is important to communicate that you are already part of a group, isn't it?ÿ That's what the cool come-off is all about.ÿ ""I don't need you, I already have a whole clique I'm a part of."" And this attitude is extended even further when we get to some of the major distinctions we hold.ÿ There are major barriers where we wouldn't even consider being friends with someone from the other side.ÿ So, our demeanor with these sorts is like they don't even exist. But here, Paul says that's got to go.ÿ God may want you to have relationships with people who are very different from you. <h2>A slave and a master</h2> For example, he says here, slaves and master should comingle as if there were no difference!ÿ Here you could come into a church, and Paul is saying that a slave and a master should be buddies!ÿ A master might sit down, and have a slave stand up to do the teaching!ÿ Because there is no distinction. This is so radical.ÿ These people are coming from two totally different backgrounds, and Paul is saying there is no distinction. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: To think of a contemporary example of such extremes, you would have to picture someone rich and powerful coming to hang out with some of us here.ÿ And not just hang out, like a visit from the president or something.ÿ But really make friends and have a peer relationship. But this principle applies to the more subtle distinctions that exist right here already, between us.ÿ Because we do have distinctions and types of people we would just prefer not to associate with. Let me say that this is OK, if you're just trying to be a person in this worldÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ But if you intend to grow spiritually, and you intend to learn what it means to have real love relationships with other people, then this whole idea of drawing lines and chosing who you will and will not associate with has got to go. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know this has been a big issue with me, since I can get real judgmental, stuck up and picky about people.ÿ And I consider myself fortunate in some ways to have come into a church where people were very differentÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Some of you may like the fact that in this group you can find so many people similar.ÿ But let me say that may not be so good ifÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>What should we measure ourselves by?</h2> Paul's point is that people have significance because of their relation to Christ.ÿ That person over there is great because he has God's Spirit. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember one of the first people I really believed this about and started to have a relationship with was this guy I met at one of the meetings.ÿ And he was this tall, thin, hill-billy type of guy who smoked a pipe.ÿ I started up a relationship with this guy.ÿ And we would spend all kinds of time discussing the things of life.ÿ And I was always amazed, every time we got together I would come away with an idea or piece of wisdom that just really got me excited.ÿ He would sit back and say, ""Now Buuuck, I don't know too much butÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ This guy was one of people in my life who really helped me to get on track with God.ÿ And he also helped to teach me that everyone has something to offerÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Here's the fact: Since God works through people to help us, if you won't associate with certain types in the church, you may be depriving yourself of what God has for you.ÿ You may miss out on the help and strength God has for you. <h1>His love for us is the basis</h1> Paul goes on here in v.ÿ12 and talks about our relationship with God.ÿ Again, he calls to mind the relationship we have with God, as Christians. It's been interesting for me to speculate over the years why it is that some folks are sold on the idea of loving others and some folks aren't.ÿ Because you see this.ÿ You see people who just aren't really interested in doing anything for anyone.ÿ They don't want to learn how evenÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And the main point of distinction between those who do have a burden to love others and those who don't, as I have come to see it, is because some have been stricken by the fact that God loves them.ÿ I say ""stricken"" because so many assume God loves them.ÿ Or, at least they believe it is more or less their right that he look on them favorably. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's like one person you could go to and say, ""God loves you,"" and their answer would be, ""No way!""ÿ Then another person you could go to and say, ""God loves you,"" and their reply would be, ""Whew!ÿ That's kind of what I had hoped.""ÿ In other words, that's the kind of attitude they were counting on.ÿ You couldn't really say that they felt they deserved it, but they were figuring on it nonetheless.ÿ They figured they probably deserved it as much as the next guy. Now, which attitude do you think is the most frequent? This is why people have such a hard time loving anyone.ÿ Once again, there is a difference between feeling like ""I'd kinda like to help folks,"" and ""I <strong>must</strong> share this love with others!""ÿ We have to be stricken by God's love for us.ÿ It is undeservedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The Bible itself acknowledges this difference. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Luke 7 <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This was one of the reasons that Paul kept citing for his high motivation in serving others.ÿ He considered himself what he called, ""the foremost of sinners.""ÿ He couldn't believe that God had reached out to him to love him after he had actually killed Christians.ÿ So Paul even says in one passage that the love of Christ <strong>compels</strong> him to do the work he did.ÿ He had to give that love away. So I really think that the Scriptures teach us that someone who is overwhelmed with God's love feels a strong burden to love others. <h2>Gospel</h2> In fact, this is true to the extent that in many places, the inner drive to love others is seen by the Bible as <strong>the</strong> identifying mark of a Christian.ÿ Jesus said it, John says itÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But the reason that love is the mark of a Christian is not because in order to be a Christian you have to love. ÿThe reason is that Christians have experienced something that makes us want to love.ÿ It is an experience is universal to all Christians, and you cannot even be a Christian without having it. The Bible puts it like this: There must first be an awareness of our own sin.ÿ Because God's position is that we need to be forgiven.ÿ It's only when we have been forgiven for our sins that we can come into his presence. And the net effect of this is that we become acutely aware of a love from God, <strong>which we do not deserve</strong>.ÿ In other words, to be a Christian is not just to say, ""Yeah, God is a God of love and I believe that.""ÿ To be a Christian is to come to God and say, ""I believe you love me, even though I don't deserve it!""ÿ This is part and parcel of seeing our sin before God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: As it says in Rom.ÿ5ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This, then, is why the Bible says of Christians that they have the quality of loving others in their lives.ÿ Because we've all experienced love that we don't deserve. Let me just say as a qualifier here that this does not always happen.ÿ Sometimes a Christian will experience God's love, undeserved, and they will not make the connection to love others.ÿ I'll tell you the reason I believe this to be: It's because we forget.ÿ We quickly forget that we are undeserving.ÿ We quickly forget the real power of God's love. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: The Bible tells a story about this in Luke 17 where Jesus healed 10 lepers.ÿ Here are 10 guys who were going to die.ÿ And they were going to die in the most gruesome manner.ÿ We don't see it much today, but leprosy is pretty uncoolÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And so, they cry out for mercy from Jesus.ÿ And he tells them to go and be healed by washing and presenting themselves to the priests.ÿ On the way, they were healed, and only one of them turns back to give credit to Christ.ÿ The rest go their own wayÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We're so excited often to be forgiven by God and have his love.ÿ But then it's also the first thing out of our consciousness sometimes too. This is why it is, then, that some find it so hard to love. <h1>The lessons we learn first</h1> Paul goes into quite a few things that should typify our relationships with each other.ÿ I just want to take a few and look at them as we have time. <h2>Heart of compassion</h2> What this is is the new perspective we get on people as our attitude changes.ÿ It has to do with seeing weaknesses in people.ÿ Before, we saw weaknesses as something to be disdained and judged.ÿ But now, our heart goes out to people.ÿ We begin to see needs where before we saw glaring faultsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I want to tell you, this has been such a struggle for me.ÿ But this heart of compassion, for me, and and I think for others as well, is really an indicator of how we're doing in this whole area of loving each other.ÿ Because you can't talk about love unless you look out and you see the people who are having trouble, the people who are different than you, and you have a heart of compassion towards them. This is absolutely basic. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I said I've had trouble here.ÿ And I mean real trouble.ÿ I'm the kind of person who is naturally cruel and judgmental.ÿ I know it, no one has to tell me.ÿ In fact, in 7th grade, I was thrown out of school for giving an English paper in front of the entire class which ridiculed one of our classmates--a guy I constantly picked on. So, this is an ability which, for me at least, has to come from God.ÿ Because what is natural is for me to be hard and uncompassionate with people.ÿ So this is why it is one of the first areas the Lord went to work on in my life, and the area he has kept up consistent pressure on ever since. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I don't think my experience is unsual.ÿ But when I first started coming around here, I felt like I was surrounded by people with a lot of problems.ÿ And the choice was clear to me, I either figure out how to care about people with problems, or I remain a little island. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: And I remember one conversation that still sticks in my mind that relates to this whole area of having compassion on people.ÿ You know sometimes when you find out about someone's problems, and you're amazed?ÿ You know when your mouth drops open?ÿ This happened one time, and I asked this guy I was driving with, ""How will he ever overcome that!?""ÿ And he said to me, ""You might find you've got a few of those yourself someday."" This is at the heart of our ability to have compassion on people.ÿ We have to see what God has done with us.ÿ I have to say, ""If God can work with me, and change me, then he can change anybody."" The point is that you begin to see hope for people.ÿ You see your own sin and your own weaknesses, and you start to view others as people who also need help and compasion: ""If they got it, they would change too!"" <h2>Forgiveness/tolerance</h2> Another big theme we see here is the idea of forgiving each other and being patient with each other's sins.ÿ There are few things that screw up Christians as much as this area.ÿ A failure in this area is like poison. The very life-blood of the Christian life is love--love between us and God, love between us and others.ÿ And our lack of forgiveness, our intolerance of other's sins is like poison in all thatÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And we have so many excuses and rationalizations for basically an inability to forgive and tolerate other's sins. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>:ÿ Sometimes we'll say, ""There's just a personality conflict between me and him.""ÿ What does that mean?ÿ Sometimes we speak of this as if it's their smellÿ.ÿ.ÿ. It's that certain things he does bother me.ÿ I don't want to forgive him and just tolerate his sins. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Sometimes we'll rationalize our failure to forgive by saying, ""There's no hope of resolution with him.""ÿ And the implication is that it's his fault. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: ""He doesn't like me.""ÿ Here's a real common one that's just full of ironyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I don't want you to get the wrong impression.ÿ Forgiveness is not exactly easy.ÿ I have never been a great one for it.ÿ I've been more of a great one for revengeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But true and genuine forgiveness is possible. 1. Realize how badly they've wronged you.ÿ Don't fudge. 2. Start to pray about it, confessing this is hard. 3. Look to your own life, to see how you have hurt people similarly.ÿ If this is hard for you, then get some help hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. 4. Try to do something positive and serving for that person. All the while, keep praying to God for the ability to forgive and forget. <h2>Let the word dwellÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Finally, one thing that should characterize the group as a whole is that God's word should dwell among us.ÿ This is a verse that often is taken to mean that each of us as individuals should have the word of Christ deeply ingrained in us.ÿ But actually, this is something that should characterize the group as a whole.ÿ God's word should be among us and characterize our relationships. This is something for us to think about in our relationships with each other.ÿ What characterizes your conversations? ÿWhat characterizes your thought life about others? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: After a whole night with someone, lots of folks have never said a word about God, about God's will for us, about God's word in any respectÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ (Need a real story about this.) <h3>These are just examples</h3> The kinds of things that are mentioned here are just examples of the type of things that we can do with each other.ÿ It says, ""teaching and admonishing, psalms and hymns.""ÿ This is not to say that every times we come together we have to sing a song, we have to quote a psalm at each other, etc. These are just ideas of how we can let God's word dwell among us. <h3>This kind of stuff is fun</h3> Now when you talk about discussing God's word with each other, most people think this is totally boring. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Imagine the kind of guy who hangs around and talks about the Bible all the timeÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03109.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1994 - Buck McCallum",
"1 Corinthians 1- Believing in Each Other",1990-01-07,,"  <h1>When you believe in peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> What we see in the first part of this letter is a trait which is so typical of Paul.ÿ He is positive and he is a believer in people. This letter which is fraught with problems.ÿ And that is because this is a church that is loaded with problems.ÿ And that is because these are people loaded with problem.ÿ But you see here?ÿ Paul is convinced of nothing but good things for them. <h2>Based on God's faithfulness (v. 9)</h2> This is an undying positivism that is based, not on some blindly optimistic view of human nature, but on the fact that God is working with these people.ÿ As he says in v.ÿ5, it was God who ""enriches them"", and in v.ÿ7, lavishes every kind of gift on these people.ÿ As he concludes in v.ÿ9, ""God is faithful.""ÿ In other words, ""No matter what problems you guys might have now, God will be faithful to you and shape you and change you."" This is why Christians have not only the basis to be positive regarding others, but an obligation.ÿ To be anything less that positive and optimistic about the future of some brother or sister in the Lord is to deny that God is at work in their lives. If you're like me, this is a problem area.ÿ And for me, the problem is that I think I understand people so well.ÿ I watch people.ÿ I try to understand what makes them tick, and then, after years of watching different types of people, what do you think I do?ÿ I categorize them.ÿ I figure out what their problems are, and once I have those figured out, then I can predict what they will do.ÿ I can predict what they will be like a year from now.ÿ I can predict what pitfalls will overcome them.ÿ On and onÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But the fact that God is in someone's life changes all that.ÿ I have to consciously take my observations and all my wisdom about predicting people and reject it, and say, ""God can surprise me.ÿ Let God surprise me with this person."" This positivism is the fuel that feeds our relationships around here.ÿ It's the fact that we can believe in each other, the fact that we can believe the best about each other, that makes us able to stick it out together.ÿ It makes us able to have relationships over the long-term. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: To think about what normally happens, I can look at my own life.ÿ Normally, in my life, when I have concluded that someone has a terminal problem, then I casually back away from that person.ÿ I separate myself from them.ÿ I'll see that someone is a liar, for example, and I will never trust them again. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Or if I see that someone is prideful, then what?ÿ I want to see them fall!ÿ I won't catch them.ÿ I won't help them.ÿ Because I'm waiting to see them fall. That's the way things normally happen when we see some kind of major flaw with people.ÿ I'm sure some of us are quicker to jump to such conclusions than others.ÿ But however long it takes, when we finally get to the point that we say, ""That person is a liar,"" or ""That person is a totally selfish,"" then we see no hope for them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was watching TV and this actor was relating how he hates doing movies about characters who go through some crisis, and then they come out on the other side a changed person.ÿ And that's the typical movie.ÿ A person is totally prideful, but then his wife and family leaves him, and he sees the error of his ways and turns over a new leaf.ÿ And this actor, who had to play a lot of roles like this, was saying, ""I hate it.ÿ Because it's so fakey.ÿ The people I know never change.ÿ They're still the same as they were in high schoolÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ And I thought, ""How refreshing!ÿ Someone who is honest about people!"" But here, among Christians with God in our lives, we can't do that.ÿ We can't conclude about people that they will never change.ÿ To do that is to say that God is not at work in that person's lifeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Instead, we believe in people and try to communicate that postivism to them. <h2>Not a naive blindness either</h2> Now as I say this, we need to realize that I am not talking about some intentional blindnesss or naivete that shuts out people's problems.ÿ As I said, Paul is going to go on and discuss the problems the Corinthians, and there are many.ÿ Paul sees them all, but this doesn't prevent him from believing the best about these people. I think people really go to extremes on this issue of how we view others.ÿ Some are so positive, they can't bring themselves to really see the truth about someone.ÿ This may be more true as we talk about someone we really love.ÿ We're always great critics of those who have nothing to do with us.ÿ But some folks feel like it is unloving to see the truth about someone close to us and call a problem a problem. But, the truth is, it is the very fact that Paul believes in these people so--the fact that he is so positive--that enables him to shoot straight and talk about their problems.ÿ Because he believes God will heal them, because he believes God will be faithful to them, Paul is free to take a hard and honest look at all their problems. In their case, as with all Christians, the existence of problems, no matter how serious, does not mean the end.ÿ It does not mean the person is a permanent loser.ÿ And this is what enables us to look squarely at our weaknesses. When I think of this I can think of my own life, and having to face some terrible truths--truths that would have be crushing if it weren't for Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In fact, I can remember one point where this was absolutely crucial for me.ÿ I had been coming around, literally, for years.ÿ And I had the opinion that I had some problems, but all I needed to do was get them under control.ÿ It was kind of like the feeling you would get if you were about 5 pounds overweight.ÿ But it wasn't until I was laying in bed one night and realizing, ""No, my whole life is screwed up!ÿ Everything is messed up.ÿ And God can change me!""ÿ That was the turning point for me.ÿ I could never have faced the depth of my problems and received healing and the change I have seen if I didn't believe that God could deal with them, no matter how serious. So, this belief in God's ability to change us is absolutely crucial to seeing the truth about ourselves.ÿ The truth would be too painful and depressing were it not for this. <h2>Blamelessÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (gospel)</h2> Something else we should note about this introduction is the fact that no matter what, these people will be regarded as blameless (Look at v.ÿ8).ÿ I make this additional point because the term Paul uses here is very strong.ÿ See how he says that they will be ""blameless to the end.""ÿ It means that they will never view them as guilty.ÿ God will never view them as blamable. Instead, what Paul is pointing out here is that no matter what these people do, God is going to forgive them.ÿ That's what it means to be blameless to the end. Just to give a feel for what he might have said.ÿ He could have said, ""I'm sure that things will work out OK for you guys, and that you'll all turn out to be good people.""ÿ I'm sure that Paul feels that, since he sees God at work in their lives.ÿ But he goes way beyond that and says, ""God will view you as blameless till the end!""ÿ It's not just that God thinks you are OK, but <strong>blameless</strong>. And this is the essence of what a Christian is.ÿ A Christian is someone whom God has forgiven, someone whom God has this view of: blameless. <h1>Divisions</h1> The first problem that Paul addresses with this church is perhaps the most serious.ÿ It is the issue of division within the church.ÿ There were parties and factions that had formed, and it threatened to divide this church into so many pieces. <strong>Read 10-12</strong> You can see what was happening here was that people were rallying around certain figure-heads.ÿ Some were saying that their loyalties were to Paul, the founder of the church.ÿ Some were saying their loyalties were to Peter, the first pope.ÿ Then some were following this charismatic leader named Apollos.ÿ And finally, there were the snobs, who claimed to be following Jesus personally. <h2>A tension here</h2> There is a real tension in the things that Paul is talking about here.ÿ Because on the one hand, we ought to have personal loyalties between us.ÿ In fact, Galatiansÿ5 says that faithfulness is a fruit of God's work in our lives. So, on the one hand, saying that I am loyal to a person or that I listen to a person is a good thing. But what is bad, is when this happens to the <strong>exclusion</strong> of others.ÿ And this is what is happening here.ÿ They were saying that they were following Paul, or Peter, and not the other guys. I want to talk about the issue of divisions, and why they were happening here in coming weeks.ÿ But the thing I want to focus on here is this element: being loyal to someone, and in the course of it shutting others out. <h2>Differences often mean divisions</h2> I think that one of the things that happens, almost instinctively with us, is that we assume that differences between people like leaders has to result in divisions. In other words, if I listen to one of you and you have a point of view on something, and then I talk to someone else and they have a different point of view, then we tend to think in our minds, ""These guys should be kings in two different countriesÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ We assume that differences between people has to result in divisions. And this is so sad, really.ÿ If, for example, you tend to get advice and leadership from one person, and someone over here is very different, and you exclude that person, you lose out. <h2>We need differences</h2> The differences of opinions and styles and belief within a church is the most healthy thing we could have.ÿ I personally feel like God has blessed me with numerous sources of input in my Christian life.ÿ And they often disagree wildly with one another. In my view, and I think this is a case that Paul is going to make in the course of the next few chapters, the diversity of viewpoints in a church is a sign of health.ÿ And, the more people you can get input from in your life, the better. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know that I learned this in part because I had to have had half a dozen or more people who really took me under their wings and tried to have their input in my life.ÿ And each and every one of them was great.ÿ I look back at lessons and changes that happened with each and every one of those people. <h2>Application</h2> I believe that if you are here as a Christian, and you only circulate in one crowd, or only have one person's input, you are hurting yourself.ÿ I believe we ought to actively seek out the input of different people. Within our home churches there are many different people we can seek out for input.ÿ And then, within the fellowship as a whole, outside your home church there are different influences.ÿ And ultimately, we ought to be seeking out reading, speakers or other forms of input from the church as a whole. What I find especially foolish and dangerous is the feeling that was being demonstrated here: That those people over there are bad or dangerous.ÿ We don't listen to them.ÿ They have nothing to sayÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03248.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","1 Corinthians - Buck McCallum",
"1 Corinthians 1: Divisions in the Church",1990-01-14,,"  <h1>Introduction: Divisions at Corinth</h1> Last week we talked about the fact that there were divisions at the Corinth.ÿ And I pointed out from vv.ÿ8-10 that one of the reasons this was happening was that people were gathering around certain figure heads, which is not such a problem in itself.ÿ The problem is that they were doing it to the exclusion of others.ÿ This is what was so serious. In fact, one thing I pointed out last week which I need to reiterate this week is that this problem was taken so seriously by Paul that it constitutes the major part of his letter.ÿ For the first 4 chapters of this letter he is going to be addressing the issue of division.ÿ It is the first issue to come up, and it is the issue he takes the longest time to deal with.ÿ So, we are talking about a most serious issue here.ÿ By it's precedence and the weight given it, we might conclude that it weighs more heavily in Paul's mind than the sexual problems they were having at Corinth.ÿ It weighs heavier than the greed problemsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We need to look into exactly why Paul considers this issue so seriously this week. <strong>Read 10-13</strong> <h1>Is Christ divided?</h1> Notice that the first thing he says about division in the church is this rhetorical question: ""Has Christ been divided?"" This statement really gets at the outrage of what is happening at Corinth.ÿ To divide the Christians is to say that Christ himself has been divided.ÿ Now, as Paul answers the question, ""Has Christ been divided?"" he says, ""No way!""ÿ But as these people answer, they say, ""Well, yeah I guess he has.""ÿ And this is horrifying to Paul. <h2>The church is Christ</h2> To get a grip on why Paul is so serious about this, we need to refresh ourselvs on something that both he and the Corinthians knew.ÿ This is a theological background here.ÿ And that is, the church is the manifestation of Christ in this world.ÿ That's why he asks, ""Has Christ been divided?"" This is a very basic teaching that Christ left behind with his disciples.ÿ He said, ""Even after I leave this earth physically, I will be with you always.""ÿ So Christ promised his presence here on earth.ÿ But the way he has done it is to come in the form of his Spirit, and indwell individual Christians.ÿ Christians have God's Spirit living within themÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, you say, ""Great!ÿ I have the Spirit of Christ in me because I am a Christian!""ÿ Not quite.ÿ Not quite.ÿ And here is something you must understand if you are going to go anywhere in your Christian life: The Spirit of God is in you as a Christian.ÿ But he is not there for you.ÿ Let me repeat, he is not there for you.ÿ He is there for others. This is an ingenious twist that God has put on the whole thing.ÿ He said, ""I'll come and live within you.""ÿ And we think that is great.ÿ But he comes to live within us, <strong>so that he can work through us to others</strong>. <h3>Scriptural support</h3> In a passage we're going to get to much later, IÿCor.ÿ12, Paul says clearly, ""Each one of us gets a manifestation of the Spirit.""ÿ And we like that.ÿ I'm glad I get to have God's Spirit within me.ÿ But the second half the verse is the whole point: ""For the common good!""ÿ Why does God give us his Spirit?ÿ For the common good! Another passage I can think of along these lines is IÿThess. 4:9, where Paul says, ""The Spirit himself will teach you about love of the brethren.""ÿ This is one of the clearest passages we have about what God's Spirit actually does within us.ÿ One thing we know he does is teach us how to love one another.ÿ His instruction is aimed at how to interact with <strong>others</strong>. Finally, if you research the term ""filling of the Spirit,"" which is a real popular term among Christians (""That man is Spirit filledÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""), you will find that it refers to when the Spirit takes us over.ÿ It refers to a strong experience of God's Spirit.ÿ But you know what else?ÿ You will always, always, find it in connection with people serving others.ÿ That's when they are filled with the Spirit.ÿ You will either find people being filled when they speak the gospel, or when they try to minister to someone else.ÿ In other words, you will experience God's Spirit when you go out to minister to others. Let me say that having God's Spirit in us for the sake of others does not mean he never does anything for me.ÿ He does lots of things for me.ÿ But, once again, that is also for the sake of others. <h3>The way we experience him: Others</h3> So, this is an understanding of God's Spirit and our experience of his Spirit that I'm sure most Christians are quite unclear about.ÿ But here's something else.ÿ Here's something else that we just don't really put together too often: If you want to experience God's Spirit, or have him work on you, then what?ÿ Then it will be through others.ÿ That's the implication of what we're talking about here. If he comes to live in me, so that he can work through me to others, then when it comes to me, and receiving God's input, it will come through others. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It would be like God coming to live at your house, which would be pretty cool.ÿ ""Hey!ÿ You're going to stay here!ÿ We'll be able to have lots and lots of good times together and lots of good talks.ÿ There are a lot of questions I've been wanting to ask you.""ÿ And he says, ""No.ÿ It's not going to be that way.""ÿ ""Huh!ÿ What do you mean!?""ÿ ""If you want to talk to me about yourself and get some input, you can go next door.ÿ I'll be over there too and we can talk there.""ÿ ""You mean to say, if I want to talk and ask some questions, I have to go all the way next door to see you there!ÿ When you live right here!?""ÿ ""That's right."" If we want God's input in our lives, he will give it to us--through other people.ÿ When Christ said, ""I will be with you,"" it was not just ""I will be in your heart.""ÿ He comes to live within us, but he speaks to us through others.ÿ And he speaks to others through each one of us. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I think there are a lot of people who haven't figured this out in their lives, and that's why they are still struggling with the same issues year after year.ÿ ""I never seem to be able to kick itÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ ""Well, who in here have you gone to for help?""ÿ ""No one yetÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" <h3>""Has Christ been divided?""</h3> This is why Paul says, ""Has Christ been divided?""ÿ To divide the church, and isolate ourselves from different portions of the church, is to cut ourselves off from God himself--Christ himself. Let me re-state this point because it shows why Paul is considering this division as so serious: To cut ourselves off from other members of the church is to cut ourselves off from Christ. This helps us to understand why the issue of division is so serious.ÿ If we divide people in the church from each other, then we also isolate them from God's work in their lives.ÿ We terminate God's work in their lives. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Think of some of the problems here at Corinth.ÿ Some people were having sexual problems--serious ones.ÿ So serious, in fact, that Paul says in one place, even the most rude and crude folks would be embarassed to discuss these problems (which kind of raises my eyebrows).ÿ By dividing the church, you cut people off from getting help for those problems.ÿ God can't help that person because they're isolated from the others. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some of these people were aparently drunks and got drunk even when they went to church.ÿ But once again, if the church is divided, then these people are alone! This is why division is so serious.ÿ Without division in the church, we all have serious problems.ÿ But with division in the church, we also have no hope of finding answers and help for those problems because we are divided from the very people God would use to help us! All the problems Paul takes up to address are of no use unless he can also heal this riftÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>I have seen it before</h3> This is something I've seen before in churches.ÿ You'll start off with some fighting. But before long, that's not the only issue.ÿ Pretty soon, it seems like everyone's personal life is falling apartÿ.ÿ.ÿ. That's because with the onset of division in a church, God's hands are tiedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>The power of the gospel</h1> Paul gives us some interesting insight about division by appealing to the example of his own life.ÿ This is something that is so typical of Paul.ÿ He addresses the problem by saying, ""Let me tell you how it is in my lifeÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Read 14-16 <h2>Why talk about baptism?</h2> He brings up the fact that he didn't really baptize all that many people at Corinth.ÿ I think he brings this up because the rite of baptism might have caused some to feel they had a special link with Paul or whoever baptized them.ÿ Maybe this was one of the things that gave rise to the partisanship. But Paul says, ""Look, I didn't get into that stuff.""ÿ But there's a reason he didn't get into it. <strong>Read v.ÿ17</strong> <h2>There's one thing that makes it for meÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> The point he is making here is that instead of getting into all this side-light stuff, like who baptized who and who you follow, Paul is into basically one thing, preaching the gospel.ÿ By the term ""gospel"" he is refering to the good news of Jesus Christ.ÿ That's what the term ""gospel"" means, ""good news.""ÿ It's the good news that Jesus came and died for us.ÿ And that he offers us forgiveness because of it. The reason he goes off on this is not some selfish thing, ""Now let's talk about me.""ÿ The reason he talks about this is as a reminder of something that they had forgotten.ÿ These people had gotten away from taking the gospel--the good news of Jesus Christ--out to people.ÿ And instead they were turned inward on each other.ÿ That's what division is all about.ÿ They were looking at each other, and fighting with each other, and trying to figure out who stood where.ÿ And they had forgotten all about the powerful message of Jesus Christ. <h2>The gospel is powerful</h2> That's why Paul goes on and reminds them just how amazing and awesome the message of Jesus Christ is. Read through v.ÿ24. Essentially what Paul is saying here is that the gospel, what he also calls here the word of the cross, is more powerful than any thing that people have ever conceived of.ÿ He says, ""Bring on the scribe.ÿ Bring on the wise man.ÿ Bring on the greatest men!ÿ And none of them will come up with something as powerful and amazing as the word of the cross of Jesus Christ."" That's why he uses all this sarcastic language here.ÿ He says that God's folly--the fact that he would come and die on a cross--is more awesome than the most wise and powerful idea that a man has ever come up with. And when you think about it, the message of Jesus Christ has to be pretty darn powerful.ÿ When you think of what it has done over the years.ÿ You know, the message of Christ didn't spread with a sword, like Islam.ÿ It didn't spread with the promise of wealth and prosperity.ÿ In fact, you were likely to be persecuted if you did believe in Christ.ÿ And yet, in spite of that, it eventually spread so far and wide, that it literally overtook the Roman Empire itself. So we are dealing with something very powerful here, and that is what Paul is saying.ÿ He's saying, ""You guys have forgotten the most powerful thing, the whole reason you are Christians!"" <h2>Contrast it with what people expect</h2> Just to get a feel for why Paul is saying this, we need to contrast the message of the cross with what people normally expect from God.ÿ That's what Paul does here. He says that the Jews look for a sign from God.ÿ This is certainly not unique to Jewish people, but in Paul's day it was very typical.ÿ Even today, though, how common for anyone to seek a sign from God!ÿ ""God show me you are there!ÿ Show me what kind of God you are!"" And what are signs?ÿ Signs are things like smoke in the skyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. An appearance by an angel is one common one I hear.ÿ ""Work a miracle in my life!""ÿ But no.ÿ That's not what God did.ÿ Instead, he came as a normal human being, Jesus Christ.ÿ He didn't even come with a glow and flashing lightsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ He lived a relatively obscure life, and in the end he gave his life for the human race by dying on a cross! No one would have ever guessed, no one would have imagined that God would do this. Then Paul says, ""The Greeks seek for wisdom.""ÿ Once again, nothing unsual here.ÿ They seek for that nugget of insight that says, ""This could only be from God!""ÿ That's what he means when he says that the Greeks seek wisdom.ÿ They'll believe that something is from God when it has that nugget of wisdom they've never heard before. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Wouldn't it be something if God somehow boomed down from heaven, ""Here are four noble truths.""ÿ And the one who understands these truths and takes them to heart, he shall be savedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But no.ÿ Once again, that's not what he did.ÿ Instead, he came and died on the cross.ÿ And what he did is far more powerful than any noble truth he could have revealed. By coming and dying on the cross God is saying, ""You, the human race, you guys have a serious problem.ÿ And in order to deal with it, I have to actually come and die for you.""ÿ God is saying that our problem with him is so massive, he had to give his life for us. But there's more.ÿ He says, ""In order to come to me, you personally need the cross.""ÿ This is so powerful.ÿ He is saying, ""In order to come to me and have my acceptance, you need Jesus to die for you.""ÿ Instead of doing tricks for people, he says, ""you need to accept my death on your behalf."" ÿInstead of titillating their desire for wisdom, he says, ""No, you need to accept my death on your behalf."" Everyone has to come to God and accept his death on their behalf.ÿ God has said, ""This is the way to me.ÿ This is the way to eternal life.ÿ Accept my death on your behalf."" A rich person has to admit, ""I needed God to come and die for me."" A good person needs to admitÿ.ÿ.ÿ. A beautiful personÿ.ÿ.ÿ. There is no message so powerful as this.ÿ Because no message puts everyone in the same boat so equally as this one.ÿ All of us needed God to die for us.ÿ And coming to God is a matter of admitting that. <h2>These people had forgotten</h2> See, these people had forgotten all about this.ÿ They had forgotten that this was the message that had turned their lives around.ÿ They had forgotten that this was the most powerful message they ever heard.ÿ And they did something so typical of Christians, they started sitting around sniping at each otherÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is where division always begins.ÿ It begins when Christians start to think that the church is just a great place to be.ÿ Sure, the church is a great place to be.ÿ But that's not what it's here for and that's not what it's all about. Christians start to think the church is just a wonderful place for fellowship!ÿ And it is.ÿ But that is not what it is here for and that is not what it's all about. We start to think that the church is a place to help with our problems!ÿ And it is.ÿ But that is not what it is here for and that is not what it's all about. The church is here to communicate the good news of Jesus Christ. But we forget that, and we start to look at the church as a place for fellowship, a place for a good time, a place to help me with my problems.ÿ And when you do that, you're going to start noticing something: There are real serious problems.ÿ There are problems with the people around here.ÿ There are problems with the leaders around here.ÿ There are problems with the way we do things around here.ÿ There are problems with the way you get treated.ÿ I don't even have to know who you are!ÿ There are problems! And this is where division begins.ÿ It begins when we start to sit around and critique things and we forget why we're even here--to share the good news of J.C. <h2>He uses us in spite of our problems</h2> Here's the miracle of the church: The amazing thing about the church is that God uses us, and he uses us powerfully <strong>in spite of the many problems we have!</strong> I can go into a church, and the people are immature.ÿ The leaders are careless.ÿ The way they do things is silly.ÿ And yet many, many people are coming to meet God!ÿ Isn't it amazing? And it should be exciting.ÿ Because that means that God can use you too, in spite of how weird you are and how many problems you have. I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and improve the church.ÿ By all meansÿ.ÿ.ÿ.

In these days, you didn't have a TV.ÿ You didn't have a movie theater.ÿ So, what did you do for entertainment?ÿ Well, you went to see gladiators slash it up.ÿ I suppose they probably went to see some strippers.ÿ But if you were into more mainline entertainment, you would seek out orators.ÿ These were men who were skilled at speach, and they would make their living by speaking little ditties and bits of wisdom. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: See examples from book of quotations: ""Art lies in concealing art"" - Ovid from <em>The Art of Love</em> ""Reckon no man happy till he dies"" - Euripides from <em>Daughters of Troy</em> ""Other men live to eat, while I eat to live"" - from Diogenes Laertius ""In wine there is truth"" - Pliny the Younger from <em>Historia Naturala</em> So, this is the kind of stuff people were into.ÿ They would go to hear these guys, maybe tell a story or a bunch of wise sayings like this.ÿ And Paul is making a contrast here when he says he was into the message of Jesus and him crucified.ÿ He is saying that he was into something so totally different.ÿ <strong>They had never heard it before.</strong> <h2>An approach from experience</h2> Paul had learned this from experience.ÿ He knew what worked, he knew what was effective.ÿ And he knew that the central core of his message had to be the message of Christ and him crucified--something that is not a popular topic, ever. <h2>We tend to want God to blend in</h2> There is a tendency for us to want God, and the message of God, to blend in to the things that are popular around us.ÿ That's kind of what was happening here and Corinth, and that is where some of their trouble was coming from.ÿ They were trying to conform Christianity to some popular standards and values of the day--namely, wisdom and superiority of speach. There's evidence to say that they were trying to incorporates some of the popular philosophies into the teaching of Christ. And this is what we always tend to do.ÿ We tend to cast the Christian message in terms of ideas and values that are popular today. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There are Christians who put forward a picture of God as the God of personal happiness and comfort.ÿ The first thing they will tell you about God is that he can make you rich, or that he can help you feel better about yourself, or that he will heal you.ÿ And is it any wonder that those are precisely the same concerns that are so popular in the culture around us?ÿ They are trying to pose God as the very thing everyone is talking about anyway! Well, the truth is that God does some of those kinds of things some of the time.ÿ But it would be entirely unfair to characterize him as the God of happiness and comfort.ÿ It would be like characterizing me as a man of great strength.ÿ Sure, I amaze people sometimes, but there are lots of other thingsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There was one group who put forward the notion of ""our sexy Jesus whom we followÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ What are they trying to do?ÿ They are trying to cast Christianity as just one more face of something that is tremendously popular already. Well, the truth is, the heart of Christianity is something that no one ever thinks of, the cross of Christ.ÿ We talked a couple weeks ago about how unique this message really is--something that no man would ever come up with on his own. Remember? We pointed out that if it were up to us, God would reveal himself quite differently.ÿ If we were to say God will come and do something, it would be something like a powerful miracle.ÿ It would be something like taking over the world.ÿ But instead, when God came, he gave his life for us.ÿ He came to die on the cross. And part of the reason this is so shocking and so unexpected is simply because we don't understand the way God is anyway.ÿ We can't comprehend a God who would take it upon himself to come and die for us. <h2>He knows it works</h2> So Paul puts this aspect of the Christian message out there first and foremost.ÿ By saying that he determined to know nothing but this, it doesn't mean that he would talk about anything else.ÿ He is exaggerating to say that this is the thing he wants to emphasize. And the reason Paul does this is that he knows it works. We have other ideas.ÿ We think that what works is enticing people with a message that they already like.ÿ Not so!ÿ When people come to God because they hear he represents something they already want, they aren't coming to God.ÿ They're responding to their own wishes.ÿ They're coming to a god of their own imagination. Paul knows that it is necessary to bring people to God as he is, and this is the God who came and died for them. <h1>The primary source of support</h1> I think this brings us to the next point that Paul makes.ÿ And the next thing Paul turns to is how the message of Christ is impacts people.ÿ He is moving away from the content of the message, into the area of how the message persuades people. <h2>This does not exclude reasoning</h2> And once gain, he says that the real force of the Christian message is not in persuasive words of wisdom.ÿ He's not saying here that there are no wise things in Christianity.ÿ Nor is he saying that Christianity is not persuasive. The fact is, there are many persuasive reasons to become a Christian.ÿ And we know that Paul used them also. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: For example, we know that Paul used fulfilled prophecy when he talked to people. ÿThis is one of those things that is very persuasiveÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In Actsÿ17, it tells us that Paul's custom was to come into the synogogue and reason with them from the Scripturesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And we know from a passage like IIÿCor.ÿ5:11 that Paul considered a big part of his task to persuade men. Just what is Paul saying then? <h2>It's a question of what is the strongest reason</h2> What he is saying is that he doesn't rely <strong>primarily</strong> on the persuasion of reasoning.ÿ He sees their faith as resting on something else, namely, the Spirit of God and God's power. <h3>Not a signs and wonders thing</h3> Some folks have taken this verse here to say that Paul relied on a miracle-campaign in order to bring people to faith in God.ÿ In other words, his main tactic with these people was to wow them with miracles and healing, then they would become Christians. This is not what he is talking about at all. He is just saying that he relies more on the persuading and motivating work of God's Spirit than his own abilities.ÿ In the final analysis, he is saying, you became Christians because God's Spirit himself persuaded you to. And when he says that your faith rests on power, once again he is refering to the fact that the gospel itself has the backing of God's power.ÿ As Paul says in another passage, the message of the cross is the very power of God (Rom.ÿ1:16). He is saying that when this message goes out to people, God kind of ""drives it home,"" so to speak.ÿ God makes sure that the message of Christ is delivered with power and conviction. <h3>Needed because of our fallenness</h3> You know, when you think about it, it's really a good thing that ultimately, the reception of the gospel message is not a matter of just persuasion.ÿ Because persuasion addresses our powers of reasoning.ÿ Persuasion speaks to our mind.ÿ And even though I believe the reasons for believing in Christianity to be very strong (in fact, so strong that I believe the reasons for believing in Christianity are stronger than any other faith), they're still not strong enough to win anyone over. That may sound like a contradictory statement, but let me say why I believe that.ÿ The reason I say that is that in hearing the gospel, we are hearing something that we don't like.ÿ And we have an instantaneous negative reaction to the message of the cross. And this is because the message of the cross tells us that we have a problem with God.ÿ That's what it says.ÿ It says, `You have such a serious problem with God, that he had to come and die for you in order to forgive you!'ÿ And that, I think, is just real hard to take. It's neat to think of God coming to die for us.ÿ That shows us an amazing side to God's character.ÿ But it's only really good if I admit that I needed it.ÿ Otherwise, him coming and dying for me is really kind of nutty. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember reading a book about Jesus.ÿ And the author of this book did not believe that Jesus was God.ÿ Nor did he believe that we needed Jesus to die for our sins.ÿ But, nevertheless, it is a fact that Jesus died on the cross and something powerful happened there.ÿ So, this guy wrote a book about Jesus's death, to explain why it was so powerful, even when we didn't really need it.ÿ And the scenario he painted was absolutely incredible.ÿ He said that Jesus had a message of love to bring to the human race.ÿ But the people of his day were so selfish they wouldn't listen to him.ÿ So, eventually he decided he needed to let himself get killed, and thereby show the ultimate example of love and sacrifice.ÿ Maybe people would listen to him then (or at least remember what he had said). Let's be honest here.ÿ Anyone who thought like that today would be hospitalized.ÿ You would be really wierd to say ""I'll get myself killed so the world will see how selfish they are and how strong my love is."" And, the fact is, Jesus himself didn't think anything close to this.ÿ The fact is, if you read the accounts of Christ's crucifiction, he did not want to go through with it.ÿ Every emotion and wish in his body was pulling against it.ÿ But he knew he had to, or there was no other hope for the human race.ÿ There was no other answer for our guilt!ÿ The Bible says that without Jesus' death on our behalf, we would all stand guilty before God.ÿ And there's not one thing we could do about it. So, the cross says we have a problem with God.ÿ It's a message we don't like to hear.ÿ And here's something we need to realize about humans: We are not the dispassionate, clear-thinking, reasonable creatures we imagine ourselves to be.ÿ I haven't met that person yet.ÿ Here's the truth: If we don't like something, <strong>we will find a reason not to believe it</strong>. We will find a reason not to believe it.ÿ We will hunt, and think, and work till we find a reason.ÿ And it often doesn't even matter how good the reason is, just as long as we have some reason not to believe it--even one!ÿ This is really the way we think.ÿ If there is just one reason not to accept the Christian message, then that's good enough. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How many people have I talked to by now who won't become a Christian because they know a Christian who is a hypocrite?ÿ Or they know a Christian who mistreated them somehow? There's a reason.ÿ But is it a good reason?ÿ Come now, is God's credibility really at stake just because some person who believes in him screws up?ÿ I kind of doubt it.ÿ In fact, I see no logical connection there whatever.ÿ It would be like saying that I doubt Einstien's theory of relativity because he screwed up a math problem once--he didn't balance his checkbook one day. What people do who believe in God may be bad.ÿ But that still does not say anything about the reasons to believe in Christianity.ÿ They are separate discussions. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How many people have I talked to who have decided not to believe in Christianity because it teaches that God has the right to judge people?ÿ What kind of <strong>reason</strong> is that?ÿ I can see where you might <strong>feel</strong> that way.ÿ I can see where you might have some kind of value like that.ÿ But this is not a reason.ÿ In fact, if anything, reason would indicate that the existence of a personal God would also imply some sense of justice. But this is the way we are.ÿ When we don't like something, we find reasons to reject it.ÿ And the message of the cross, which says we have a guilt problem before God, is something which rubs us wrong. <h3>The Spirit works on us</h3> This is why it is, then, that in the final analysis, it is God's Spirit that gives us a nudge and persuades us over to him.ÿ If we didn't have God's Spirit working on us, then we would always find reasons to reject Christ. The way he does this is not to bowl us over and demand that we listen.ÿ The way he does it is just to subtley enter into the picture and suggest to us that the message of Christ is true.ÿ Jesus called it the ""conviction of the Spirit"" in Johnÿ16.ÿ Conviction is just where God's Spirit causes us to sense a leaning or a sympathy for what we're hearing. Without this, none of us would become Christians.ÿ But even with the work of the Spirit to persuade us, we still have the ability to reject him.ÿ That's the amazing thing about the human will, just how strong it really is.ÿ We can hear good reasons.ÿ We can even sense that those reasons are correct by the conviction of God's Spirit.ÿ And wil will still be able to reject what we're hearing. <h2>We have to speak the word</h2> Let me conclude with this note here.ÿ Paul says that he came to town and brought the message of the cross.ÿ And as he did so, he spoke it with the power and conviction of God's Spirit. Now, I know a lot of people who have told me that they never really sense God's Spirit at work in their life.ÿ They never sense God's Spirit speaking through them.ÿ But you know, at the same time, what we'll find is those same people never talk to anyone about the message of Christ!ÿ They never get down to brass tacks and discuss the event of the cross or the fact that we need God's forgiveness. Now, you tell me, why does God's Spirit need to help us talk about sports?ÿ Why does God's Spirit need to help us talk about the weather?ÿ Why does he need to help us socialize and be friendly?ÿ Those are all things that I'm sure you can do. If you want to see God's Spirit come alive and start to work in you, start to talk to someone about Christ.ÿ Start to talk to someone about their need for God's forgiveness.ÿ People are always amazed by this when they first experience it.ÿ They say, ""I started talking about Christ, and it seemed as if God took over and it wasn't even me talkingÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03250.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","1 Corinthians - Buck McCallum",

"The Supernatural: How Do We Know?",1991-02-06,,"  <h1>Introduction</h1> I would like to take this week and several weeks to come on the topic of the supernatural.ÿ I have been interested to study it lately, and I think that it might have some good application for us here.ÿ By the supernatural, I am talking about the existence of beings who don't need a body. Today these things are being accepted by everyone.ÿ Over 1/3 of the movies released last year had elements of the occult.ÿ Usually, they are called, ""Horror flicks.""ÿ But they feature demons, spirits and forces which are at work for evil in the world around us. Virtually every newspaper has sections devoted to astrology and future telling of various kinds. Now these 900 numbers have your own personal fortune teller.ÿ And tarot cards and ouigi boards are common toys. All these are remnants of occult practice that have been around for centuries.ÿ Of course, today we believe that they may be manifestations of more natural forces, like waves or powers that emanate in the world around us.ÿ ""Benign forces.ÿ Maybe they're patterns that have always been around and now we're just starting to understand them?!""ÿ Which is kind of a weird thought.ÿ Because when I deal with a ouigi board, it is communicating to me.ÿ And when I read tarot cards, that is a communication. Well, when I was down at OSU, they tried to convince me that monkeys could talk.ÿ But no one has ever tried to convince me that waves, particles and forces could speak to me!ÿ Communication is something which is very personal!ÿ That's what makes it significant. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Just think of it for a moment.ÿ If you go to the beach, and the waves have left a pattern in the sand, you wouldn't say, ""What is the ocean trying to tell me?""ÿ Would you?ÿ Unless, of course, you believed that there were sea-nymphs. But that's just the point.ÿ Personal beings communicate.ÿ Things don't communicate unless they are somehow animated by personal beings. So, what I'm driving at here is that it is a dangerous, foolish and naive thing to assume that things like cards, voices, and various signs are harmless manifestation of impersonal forces.ÿ If you just think about it for a second, I think you'll realize that impersonal forces don't talk to you. If there are personal forces out there communicating to us, then we need to know, what are they like?ÿ What are their intentions?ÿ Do they want good?ÿ Or do they want bad?ÿ Are they powerful?ÿ Can I control them?ÿ Or will they control me? These are the kind of questions we are going to be studying over the next several weeks.ÿ But first, we need to think about how we know about these things.ÿ Because these matters are very mysterious.ÿ They are very strange.ÿ And everyone seems to have an opinion.ÿ So, how do we know? <h1>God's existenceÿ.ÿ.ÿ. supernatural</h1> As we sit here tonight, having a Bible study, obviously one thing we take for granted here is the existence of God.ÿ Althougyh maybe we shouldn't.ÿ Maybe that's something that some of us need to look into further. One of the implications of God's existence is that there is a supernatural realm.ÿ That follows automatically from affirming that he exists.ÿ Because he is supernatural.ÿ He is spiritual, in that he exists without the aid of a body. <h2>How do we find out about God?</h2> But here again we have the same question.ÿ If we look at things and come to the conclusion that it is most likely that a God exists, how are we supposed to find out about him?ÿ How are we supposed to know, ""Oh, this is what he is like""? Lots of people would answer that we should look at the world around us.ÿ But there are a couple problems with that.ÿ One is that the world around me gives a bunch of different pictures.ÿ Which one am I supposed to look at? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Should I look at the beauty of a fall day and say, ""God is truly a genius who loves beauty?""ÿ Or should I look at the violence of this world and say, ""God is a sadist who loves to watch pain?"" The fact is, looking at the world around us gives us mixed messages.ÿ And we don't have any criteria to judge which message we should look at. But beyond that, there is the problem of our own bias.ÿ The fact is, you look at the world your way, and I look at it my way.ÿ How we interpret things is entirely different. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It wasn't too long ago I was sitting at a stoplight and kind of drifting off in my mind.ÿ I was watching the car next to me.ÿ The light hadn't turned green yet, but he started moving forward.ÿ He kept moving forward and I was wondering, ""Why is he going to run that red light?""ÿ Just after that thought occured to me, I smashed into the car in back of me! This is how we are.ÿ We each see things differently and are convinced that our perspective is the right one. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: And let's not forget, mental institutions are filled with people who think that they are experts on the spiritual realm.ÿ They are convinced that they understand it better than any of us. <h2>We need revelation</h2> So it is, then, that as Christians we believe we need revelation.ÿ We believe that in order to find out what God is like, he needs to reveal himself. This is why we look to the Bible, which claims to be written by God. And there is some very good evidence for that, which you should concern yourself with.ÿ The Bible is not a book which just says, ""Here I am from God.""ÿ It also provides proof and vindication by means like prophecy.ÿ One of these weeks we'll have to look into biblical prophecy as it has been fulfilled in history, because it gives some good reason to believe the Bible is what it claims to be. On the topic of communications from God, you should also know that the Bible is one of very few books that claim to be one.ÿ And the others, such as the Koran or the Book of Mormon, are actually extensions of the Bible.ÿ In other words, they don't claim to be in place of the Bible.ÿ They claim to be <strong>in addition to</strong> the Bible. So I think at the very least we owe it to ourselves to see what the Bible says about God, what it says about the supernatural, and so on. I am going to assume tonight that the Bible is God's word.ÿ But let me tell you, I haven't always assumed that.ÿ I have put the Bible under a microscope to look at it and see if it can stand up to scrutiny.ÿ After years of this, let me say that I am very satisfied. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know that some people talk about the contradictions in the Bible.ÿ It is kind of funny, though, that almost without exception when I ask people for an example of one, they don't have one.ÿ But I do know of places that appear to be contradictions.ÿ I have looked at them very carefully and have yet to find a problem or a supposed contradiction to which there is not a very good answer. I think people throw around the contradiction line as something that ""everybody knows.""ÿ Just like everybody knows you don't step on cracks, or everybody knows you aren't supposed to take wooden nickels.ÿ It's a piece of folklore that has grown popular, and I'm not sure why.ÿ Why not step on cracks?ÿ Why not take a wooden nickel?ÿ It's probably worth more than a real one! Why do people always say that the Bible is full of contradictions?ÿ I have to wonder if it's not just an easy way to write the whole thing off.ÿ ""I don't have to pay any attention to it, because everyone knows it's full of contradictions."" I feel like I'm about as skeptical and critical as the next person.ÿ Let me challenge you with the notion that I don't believe that.ÿ I don't believe that and I would love to talk to anyone afterwards or any time in the future about the Bible's supposed contradictions. Don't get me wrong.ÿ I still look at some things in the Bible and have problems.ÿ I see things that bother me.ÿ And I am still looking into things.ÿ But I have yet to find a contradiction or a problem so large that I say, ""This can't be God's word."" Most of the problems I have are problems that come from my own sensiblities.ÿ I have problems with some of the stuff that we are going to talk about tonight.ÿ But those problems aren't because I know better and I can prove the Bible is wrong.ÿ When I see the Bible saying strange things about the supernatural, I say, ""How can these things be!?""ÿ And it puzzles me.ÿ If it weren't for the fact that the Bible speaks with such integrity elsehwere, I would never believe it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example:</span></em> The Bible speaks of spirits who are sometimes so numerous that they completely cover the hills and the surounding landscape. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example:</span></em> Jesus, in the Bible, speaks of spirits who leave a man, and fly over ""waterless places,"" and then they can't find a place to stay.ÿ So they come back to the man they left and bring seven friends.ÿ What kind of a picture is that?! So these are the kind of problems I have.ÿ They're problems because they stretch my view of things. <h1>Beware of the arrogance of knowing everything</h1> But here is the danger: just because we see things like this in the Bible that are hard to believe, we can't be so arrogant as to write them off. We need to beware of the arrogance which says, ""I know everthing there is to know about the world around me.""ÿ It's an arrogance that scoffs at the supernatural.ÿ We don't understand it.ÿ It's something that hasn't touched our small world of experience.ÿ So, it's not real.ÿ And people who believe in that kind of stuff are kind of nutty. I know about this attitude because I've had it myself.ÿ Don't fall into that trap. <h1>What the Bible says</h1> So we'll assume that the Bible is God's word for now, and study it.ÿ And it's there that we'll look for information on the supernatural realm.ÿ Because God does affirm the existence of other beings besides himself.ÿ And he affirms that not all of them are aligned with him, but that some of them are actually against him. Let's look into some of the things that the Bible says by way of introduction. <h2>Who is Satan and where did he come from?</h2> The first supernatural being that appears in the Bible aside from God is Satan.ÿ We find that somehow he is allowed in the garden of Eden to tempt the first humans.ÿ It's so amazing because he is just there.ÿ He is taken for granted.ÿ We aren't told very much about him at all, and yet his effect is absolutely devastating! <h3>He is awesome</h3> So, we begin to look at the rest of the Bible to find out about him.ÿ Well, one thing we know about Satan is that he is very powerful.ÿ In Judeÿ1:9, Jude tells us that Michael the archangel, who the Bible portrays as very powerful, does not have the authority or power to rebuke Satan.ÿ Even Michael has to treat Satan with respect and can't rebuke him on his own authority.ÿ So it appears that Satan is the most powerful of all the supernatural beings, apart from God himself. This is confirmed by a text in the OT that seems to be about Satan.ÿ In Ez.ÿ28, there is a passageÿ.ÿ.ÿ. You see by this imagery that Ezekiel is trying to portray someone who is very powerful.ÿ By saying he is the cherub who covers, for example, he is saying that he was the cheiftainÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>His downfall: Pride</h3> This passage also gives us insight into what it was that caused Satan's downfallÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is confirmed in IÿTim.ÿ3:6, where Paul says that conceit was what entrapped the Devil. <h3>He believes great thingsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h3> This gives us great insight into what Satan is all about.ÿ What we're seeing is that Satan believes great things about himself.ÿ In fact, by rebelling against God, he is saying that somehow he is greater than God!ÿ Somehow, or in some way (maybe he thinks every way!), he is greater than God! Which tells us a couple things: For one, it tells us that this individual is insane.ÿ Now I hope you understand what I am saying by that statement.ÿ I am not saying that he is stupid.ÿ Insanity has nothing to do with intelligence.ÿ What I am saying is that Satan has decisively rejected reality.ÿ That's what insanity is, a rejection of reality. And he has done so to an extent that nobody else has, ever.ÿ He knows what God is like.ÿ We may wonder, but he knowsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And in spite of this, he has decided that he is greater.ÿ It is an amazing position to take. But the second thing we can see about Satan's nature from all this is that he is building something.ÿ He believes that he is building something great.ÿ He is inflated with himself.ÿ He believes in himself.ÿ And so he is setting up a kingdom to be a reflection of his greatness. Some people are so silly that that think of Satan in terms of this guy who goes around making mischief--trying to get people to do things bad. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What business does someone of this stature have in making people steal cookies?ÿ Or cheat on a test? That's not what he's about!ÿ He is about himself.ÿ He is building for himself.ÿ And he is trying to accomplish something great.ÿ But this is often the way he is portrayed in movies and books.ÿ A guy who just goes around trying to get people to be naughty like he is. Not at all.ÿ Satan is intelligent.ÿ He is opposed to God.ÿ And the reason he is opposed to God is that he believes his way is better.ÿ So is is busy building.ÿ He is busy building a kingdom of some kind. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In Matt.ÿ16, Jesus portrayed Satan's domain as a kingdom, complete with gates and fortifications.ÿ And he said that one of the jobs of the church will be to batter down the walls of that kingdom. Well, we'll talk about this in coming weeks.ÿ But I just want to make the point about Satan's nature, according to the Bible: He is upside down in his perspective about the world (that is, he is insane).ÿ Secondly, he is building on that assumption.ÿ He is in the world, actively building something. <h1>What about demons?</h1> Now, let's turn to a question that effects us perhaps more than talk about Satan.ÿ The question of demons.ÿ There is only one Satan.ÿ But when it comes to demons, there are more than one.ÿ And if we are going to run into any of these spiritual beings, chances are the individual we run into won't be Satan himself, but one of these lesser beings, a demon. What in the world is a demon?ÿ And how many demons are there?ÿ These are two great questions we can conclude with here. <h2>What is a demon?</h2> The explanation that has been more or less accepted throughout the ages is that demons are angels that have also fallen away from God along with Satan. This is backed up by Rev.ÿ12:4, 9, where it says that a third of the angels fell from heaven along with Satan. And, in Matt.ÿ25:41 Jesus specifically says that Satan has angels who are aligned with him. So, it appears that demons are angels, who have made the choice along with Satan to defy God.ÿ Now, I want to talk more about what kinds of demons are.ÿ And I want to talk about how demons effect us, etc.ÿ But that is going to be for later weeks. <h2>How many are there?</h2> But for this week, I though we might settle the question of just how many demons there are in the world.ÿ Does anyone have any idea?ÿ How would we find out this kind of thing? Well, there are some numeric indicators. <h3>Rev.ÿ5:11 / 12:4</h3> It says in Rev.ÿ5:11 that the host of heaven is numbered ""myriad upon myriad and legions of leagions.""ÿ This means 10,000 times 10,000. and thousands of thousands.ÿ I'm sure that the impression John is trying to give is that there were so many it was like a sea of individuals.ÿ So many it was useless counting. OK, we keep that in mind.ÿ Add this to the fact that in Rev.ÿ9 the host of heaven is compared to the stars of the sky, and I think that the author of Revelations is trying to say that there are a lot of angels! And the important point for out study is that in Rev.ÿ12:4, John says a third of them went with Satan!ÿ So if there are countless millions of angels, and a third of them went with Satan, then there are a lot of demons. <h3>Application: Would they mess with me?</h3> Why am I discussing the number of demons?ÿ Is this just some wierd thing I get into? Not at all.ÿ I will say this with some good deal of confidence: Probably most of you don't think that you get messed with by demons very much, if ever.ÿ If you aren't that familiar with the biblical teaching on demons, perhaps most of you don't think you ever get harassed by demons ever. And I think one of the implications of what we are studying is that there is good reason to believe otherwise.ÿ If it is true that there are millions of demons in the world, then chances are very good that you will get the attention of at least one of them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There's a story in Markÿ5 about a guy who was possessed by demons.ÿ When Jesus asked how many there were, they replied that there was a legion of them!ÿ Now, a legion is 1000!ÿ I don't know if these guys were being precise or what.ÿ But there were a lot of demons in this guy.ÿ They said, ""We are many!"" Ask yourself, what are hundreds of demons doing in some guy who runs around in a graveyard gashing himself?ÿ What in the world are they doing there?ÿ Isn't there something better they could be doing? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I'll give you another example.ÿ In Lukeÿ13 there was a woman, Luke tells us, that was bent over by a demon for 18 years!ÿ A demon had made it his personal business to cause this woman's back to bend over. What in the world is this all about? I think the implication is clear:ÿ There are a lot of demons in the world.ÿ And they have the time and motivation to screw around with just about anybody.ÿ If they will take the time to bend over an old lady for 18 years, what will they think about you?ÿ You, who are a Christian?ÿ You who Christ said, ""You will be victorious over Satan's kingdom?""ÿ I wonder if they have the numbers, time or motivation to work you over some?ÿ I think so.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03576.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum",,
"Why Believe the Bible: Interpretation",1991-02-13,,"  <h1>Intro: The assumption of communication</h1> Before we get into this interpretation business, I want you to think about the last real good fight you had with someone.ÿ It may have been one of those long-term irritations, with periodic outbursts--a low key conflict.ÿ Or, it may have been an argument that got loud and animated.ÿ Maybe it was a disagreement that went on for a couple days with several arguments. If you never get in arguments or fights with anybody, I suggest you seek out some counseling as soon as possible. Take a minute and think about that fight.ÿ Think about what it was that irritated you about the other person.ÿ Sure, they may have had a weird point of view.ÿ But go beyond that.ÿ What was it about the way they acted or argued that made you want to <strong>fight</strong> with that person? As you think about that, I'm going to bet that about 90% of us here are thinking about the fact that the other person didn't listen to us.ÿ They didn't understand us.ÿ They assumed what we meant.ÿ They put words into our mouths.ÿ They misrepresented our point of view. When I talk to people about their fights, in one way or another, the biggest complaint is always, ""He doesn't listen to me.""ÿ Or, ""He doesn't understand me.""ÿ Or, ""He may think he knows what I'm saying, but he doesn't!"" What is it about this that makes us so angry?ÿ Why is it that when someone takes our point of view and twists it, that just sends us off? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have to admit, I know this is true.ÿ And in the past, I have not always argued fairly with the people I disagree with.ÿ One of the tactics I have used in the past is to throw someone off balance by purposefully misrepresenting their point of view.ÿ ""So, you're saying it angers you when you don't get your way?""ÿ ""No I'm not!ÿ That's not what I'm saying!""ÿ ""OK, OK, just slow down and try and explain yourself.""ÿ But now they're all angry and they aren't thinking straight. Let me tell you, that form of argumentation is not right.ÿ And unless you want to get into some good fights, you should probably refrain from using such tactics. But why?ÿ Why does it bother us so much when people take liberty with our words? I think it's because there is an assumption there.ÿ There is an assumption that if someone respects me, then they will understand me.ÿ When someone doesn't take the time and care to listen to me, then that means they don't respect me. Or, if you're like me, I'm not always aware of how I am being affected by something.ÿ A lot of people are immediately in touch with that.ÿ But I'm more focused on what I perceive about other people.ÿ And when I sense someone who doesn't take the time to really listen to me, then I start to feel like I'm dealing with an egotistical, fat-headed loud-mouth.ÿ They're not listening to me because they have some kind of attitude! So this is the way it is with us.ÿ We consider it a matter of respect, for people to take the time listen to us and understand us.ÿ And a lot of us would start to judge the character of someone who doesn't listen. And yet, here's the point for our study, many people feel the freedom to do this to the Bible any time they want!ÿ They feel the freedom to read whatever they want.ÿ They feel the freedom to find what they want to find in there. And we even justify it by using pat-lines like, ""Everybody knows you can read whatever you want in the Bible.""ÿ Or, ""It's all just a matter of interpretation."" That may be true for some of you out there, I don't know.ÿ But if you treat me that way in a personal conversation, then you might have an argument or a fight on your hands. The Bible also is a communication.ÿ It is a book, or series of books.ÿ The Bible also has authors, the ones who penned that communication. Now here's what we have to consider: Where they different than us?ÿ Were they sitting there writing and thinking, ""This could mean whatever you want it to mean?""ÿ ""I'll bet no one will really understand me here!"" What kind of idiot would write a book like that? I take that back.ÿ There are popular art-forms today where people think that's really neat to compose something that everyone can read differently. Let me assure you of something, the Bible is not a work of art in that sense.ÿ It is an intentional communication.ÿ It is a speach-act.ÿ There is a speaker, there was a designated audience.ÿ There was a purpose. I use the term ""intenional"" because in this communication there were authors who had intentions.ÿ They had reasons.ÿ That's the same thing you and I have when we communicate.ÿ And that's the same thing we get so angry about when people misread it. If we are going to respect the Bible as a communication, then we must respect the intention of that author--just the same as you would respect the intention of any speaker you were dealing with.ÿ I'm not even saying, ""Hey, work at understanding the Bible because it's God's word.""ÿ We've been talking about that for the last couple weeks.ÿ And I do believe that the authority the Bible has should make us work even harder to understand what he intention of the author was. But really, all I'm advocating here is just give it the same level of respect that you would give anyone.ÿ Listen to it. And let's do away with this myth that says, ""The Bible can mean anything you want it to mean."" The goal of interpreting the Bible is the same as any other communication: Let's try to understand what the author intended.ÿ This is not just a book that has been floating around for hundreds of years.ÿ This is a book, authored by people.ÿ We must try to establish what those authors were intending. <h1>Different levels of difficulty</h1> Now, having said that, I realize that there are some passages in the Bible that are hard to understand.ÿ We want to understand what that author intended.ÿ But we have a hard time. So, I want to acknowledge, there are different levels of difficulty in the Bible.ÿ Along those same lines, I want to acknowlege that the fact that the Bible was written so long ago makes is more difficult than, say, a converstion.ÿ With a conversation you have the person right there to clarify what they meant.ÿ With the Bible, we have to work at it a little harder. So, I'll put this notion out to you.ÿ It is possible to interpret the Bible, and be pretty darn sure of what the authors intended us to understand.ÿ But, that doesn't mean it's always easy. Some passages are easier than others. And we can thank God that the most important truths have been written in the Bible in very straightforward language, over and over again, so that there can be no mistaking what the Bible is trying to say. This is one of the things that helps us determine the difference between what we call an essential, central teaching of the Bible, and one that is more peripheral or tentative.ÿ I don't want to say unimportant, because many important things are said in a way that makes them hard to understand. But we know some things so clearly because the biblical authors state them so often and with such a blunt style. <h2>God loves us</h2> For one, the Bible is ultimately clear on the fact that God loves us.ÿ This is a message that screams so loud, many people would call that a fair description of the entire Bible: God's message of love to us. Let's look at how simply and straightforward this is said is many places. John 3:16: I'll take one that, as Jeff said last week, is real famous from football gamesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" Rom. 5:6-8 You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.ÿ Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.ÿ But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.ÿ (NIV) I John 4:10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.ÿ (NIV) All these verses are talking about the fact that God loves us so much, he came here in the form of Jesus Christ and died for us, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life. The Bible is clear from beginning to end that God loves us.ÿ Jesus told stories that were powerful illustrations of it.ÿ He told stories like the prodigal son, in Lukeÿ 15, which I'm not going to read now.ÿ But you should because it's strong. God loves us.ÿ The Bible says it over and over again.ÿ You can't miss it.ÿ And yet, I'll bet some of you who aren't very familiar with the Bible may have thought something else.ÿ A lot of people think the Bible is a book of restrictions.ÿ A lot of people think the Bible is a book of outdated stories. But the Bible is about God's intense love for us.ÿ The Bible is a challenge, a proposition from God to us, ""Will you lay aside your pride and accept God's love?""ÿ Will you come to him and acknowledge that you need his forgiveness?ÿ Will you believe him when he says that he loves you so much, he wants to completely accept you and have a relationship with you? That's without a doubt the central message of the Bible.ÿ I hope that you will leave here tonight considering it. So, the Bible has a central message that is often repeated and very clear.ÿ That is certainly something to focus upon. And, if you want to get more into the Bible, Jesus Christ, etc., let me suggest a book of the Bible that is very, very easy to understand and very instructive: John. ÿIt's easy to remember, just look it up in your table of contents in that big old white thing that gathers dust on the family end-table. <h1>A basic approach to interpretation</h1> I want to leave you with an outline for understanding the Bible.ÿ This will be quick.ÿ But it should get you on your way to interpreting the Bible.ÿ If you want to go further, I am going to suggest a couple books.ÿ I will also tell you about a couple classes. But you should know, in response to the dilemma of understanding someone's communication, countless hours of brilliant people's time has gone into developing a science of interpretation.ÿ The Bible has been poured over by some of the most brilliant minds that this world has known.ÿ And, while they don't all agree on everything it says, there is substantial agreement on how we should go about understanding it. This is the science of interpretation, or hermeneutics. <h2>What about the text?</h2> The first step in understanding the Bible is to make sure that we have a good text to read.ÿ Lot's of people you hear say things like, ""How can you trust the Bible when it has been copied by so many people all through the ages?""ÿ Or, ""There are so many versions of the Bible, how can you trust any of them?"" There are two issues here.ÿ The first is the question of how reliable the copies of the Bible we have today are.ÿ And to that question, I smile and say, the text of the Bible we can work from today is so reliable it is hardly even worth quilbling about anymore. You probably know that he Bible was written originally in Hebrew, Greek and a few parts in Aramaic.ÿ The science of working from our copies back, to try and reconstruct the originals, is called ""textual criticism."" Now it just so happens that some of the most meticulous, anal retentive people in the world's history decided not to become accountants and have instead become text critics. They have taken from the thousands and thousands of manuscripts we have of the Bible (by far more than any ancient text), and made charts, tables, comparisons and little precise measurements of everything. It's to the point that of all the 10's of thousands of words in the Bible, less than 5% of them are in question at all.ÿ Only about 1% are actually in serious debate.ÿ And when you take all of those that are in serious question, only about 5% of them are important or significant words.ÿ In other words, they are mostly ""a"" versus ""the,"" or a plural versus a singular. So, you can rest fairly confident in the fact that we know what the authors wrote, in the original languages. <h2>A good translation</h2> But, that still says nothing about your English translation.ÿ And there are a lot of problems there. Let me tell you a couple things that I stay away from. I stay away from translations that are done by one denomination. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some of you may have Catholic Bibles.ÿ I believe that the Catholic scholars have done a very good job with their translation.ÿ But, I feel much safer when a Bible is translated by a board of scholars from many different denominations.ÿ That way they have to argue about it and find a compromise. I stay away from translations that are too hip and groovy.ÿ Some translators have gone real far in making the Bible readable.ÿ I think this is an honorable goal.ÿ But you should realize that the more a translator re-works those words to make them understandable to you, the more he is interpreting. So, some of the English translations we have are highly interpreted by their translators. Let me give you here a scale.ÿ It's kind of a subjective scale.ÿ But it's a scale which tells us a little bit about the popular English translations.ÿ On the one end would be those translations that are highly readable, but are also for that reason highly interpreted.ÿ On the other end are those translations which are very literal in their approach, but they sacrifice some readability. I believe that if you want to work on understanding a passage, compare at least two translations.ÿ I use both the NIV and the NASB. <h2>Read it</h2> When we are talking to each other and we fail to communicate, what is the single greatest barrier to understanding?ÿ What is it that time after time foils our attempts to get through to someone? We don't listen. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Haven't you ever been talking to someone and their mouth is open?ÿ What does that mean about how they are listening?ÿ Can you listen through and open mouth? What it means is that we are so consumed with our thoughts.ÿ We are so set on being heard, that we can't hear other people. That is the problem with biblical interpretation.ÿ It's more of a problem with the Bible than any other communication because people already have ideas on how they want things to be.ÿ In the arena of the spiritual, God, the afterlife, and weighty issues like these, people have a way they would like things to be.ÿ Or, at the very least, they know the things that they don't like.ÿ And they come to the Bible with all those things. ""I've got a fistful of ideas that I'd better not find here."" ""I've got a bunch of things I really like and really believe are true."" So we bring all those things to the Bible.ÿ We have our mouth wide open while we're supposed to be trying to listen.ÿ We're waiting to talk.ÿ We're waiting to interject. This is where I suggest reading the Bible.ÿ So many of our problems with interpretation would be solved if we just read the Bible. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I see this all the time, because I lead Bible studies.ÿ We'll often read a passage and then I'll ask people what they think it means.ÿ Someone will say, ""Blah blah blah.""ÿ And I'll ask, ""Where did it say that?""ÿ And they look at me with their mouth open.ÿ They have their mouth open.ÿ Just put your finger on the text and show me where it says that. I think this is why it's really good for people to read the passage they want to look at, at least twice.ÿ At least twice.ÿ That does two things: It makes us slow down and shut our mouth. It makes us understand things in terms of their context.ÿ We take the time to get the bigger picture. <h2>Study any words that are unfamiliar to you</h2> The third step on understanding the text would be to study any words or phrases that are unfamiliar to you.ÿ There are obviously English dictionaries if you are unfamiliar with the English term.ÿ But there are also dictionaries that help you to understand what the term meant in the original language. Here are two of themÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Compare your findings with others</h2> Finally, compare your findings with others.ÿ You need to consult commentaries, tapes or other interpreters to bounce your ideas off them.

"Marriage &amp; Dating: Dating",1991-03-10,," <h1>Introduction</h1> I want to talk about the actual issue of dating tonight.ÿ We've talked about relationships between the sexes in terms of our sexuality.ÿ And we've talked a little bit about how the different sexes approach each other or what they're looking for.ÿ But now dating. In case you didn't know, dating is a relatively modern phenomenon.ÿ In the history of human relations, it is a newcomer.ÿ It wasn't done in biblical times.ÿ Therefore it is difficult to go to the Bible and find material specifically on this issue. Today, we having dating.ÿ Couples can explore each other in virtually every way before they make a commitment to each other. So, there is a tension in dating.ÿ On the one hand, we say that every relationship needs to be conducted on the basis of godly love.ÿ By godly love, we talk about the kind of love that gives to other.ÿ It's the kind of love that doesn't seek to satisfy itself, but rather it seeks to sacrifice for others. On the other hand, it seems like dating is something that you do for the thrill of it.ÿ Doesn't it?ÿ When you date, you aren't commiting yourself.ÿ You aren't giving completely of yourself to another person like in marriage.ÿ But you are getting quite a bit.ÿ You're getting a thrill.ÿ You're getting good times.ÿ You're getting some strong love feelingsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, how are we to understand this tension? Let me say that people are sometimes real imbalanced about this.ÿ Some go to the extreme of saying that you must never enter into a relationship where you aren't completely sacrificial.ÿ In other words, you musn't be looking for a good time.ÿ Let's face the facts, dating is fun.ÿ It wouldn't be so popular if it weren't. One of the ways you'll hear this point of view is when we hear, ""You can only date someone if you are thinking about marrying that person.ÿ If you know you're not going to marry that person, then you're just being completely selfish."" Like I said, I think that's an extreme position.ÿ To say that I can't have a relationship with someone of some degree of intimacy, without having in mind a lifetime commitment on the scale of marriage, is a very strong condition you're putting on relationships.ÿ To put it in the realm of other relationships, we know that we get involved with people very deeply.ÿ We get attached.ÿ And sometimes when we do this, we move on, physically or otherwise. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: One of my best friends ever, if not my best friend ever, Mark Batcheck, is going to go the mission field in a year or two.ÿ And he's going without me!ÿ We've been together for over ten years in everything.ÿ There's a lot of emotional attachment there.ÿ But I can't say that somehow he has ripped me off!ÿ I've only benefitted from him.ÿ I'm better off.ÿ I sure am glad that he didn't say, ""Well, I'm not sure I can always be here, so maybe we'd better not get too involved."" Now I realize that the attachment and the emotions are deeper in relationships between the sexes.ÿ But, the deep hurts--the scars--come not from the fact that people date without intention of marriage.ÿ It's what they do when they are dating that hurts.ÿ And we'll talk about that in a bit. Then there's some folks over on the other extreme.ÿ They feel like you should just be able to go around and jump from relationship to relationship, without any concern for how they might be effecting the other person.ÿ These people are dangerous.ÿ Their conscience seems to be dictated only by their desire.ÿ And that's really a bad combination. I want to talk first about the advantages to dating--why I think it's good.ÿ But then I want to talk about some of the dangers which are present that lead to a lot of trouble. <h1>The advantages of dating</h1> When it comes to the advantages of dating, I think that they are enough that dating is a great thing.ÿ The order of my teaching might leave you with the impression that I don't approve of dating.ÿ That's definitly not true.ÿ I wish a lot more of it happened, and in a healthier way. <h2>The need to overcome the mystery</h2> I think that one of the best things about dating is that it enables us to overcome the mystery of the opposite sex.ÿ And we really need to overcome that mystery.ÿ In a general sense, whether we ever get married or not, this is our other half.ÿ We are supposed to benefit from all these other humans.ÿ But we're separated from them by a wall of mystery and misunderstanding. It's really too bad, because this culture teaches us that the opposite sex is a group of people out there that you're supposed to capture.ÿ Or, you're supposed to become an object of desire for them.ÿ A lot of self-image is tied up with how well you can do this. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Think if you treated the people of the same sex that way?!ÿ ""My object is to get him to love meÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ ""I want those guys over there to notice meÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" It would be so wierd.ÿ And of course there are lots of people who are exactly this way!ÿ And that's why they can never be themselves with anyone.ÿ They're always putting on a show to try and impress or win someone's attention. But this is the falsehood that rules between men and women. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Guys will do things like a moose in the rut.ÿ They will get together in the presence of women.ÿ And when normally they might just talk about an issue like football or school in everyday tones and manerisms.ÿ In the presence of a woman, they will start to talk louder, exaggerate more, and show their dominance, smartness or coolness over the other guys in the group.ÿ I have watched men at a table, when they knew they were being watched by women go on telling their stories, with over a couple dozen stories being swapped, anxiously, loudly, with lots of fanfare, without one person ever stopping to be interesting in the other guy's story.ÿ Not one question, ""Oh, really?ÿ So was that fun for you?"" For all the world, they might as well as be a bunch of roosters parading their feathers around! So there is a barrier between the sexes which should certainly be broken down between us here.ÿ As Christians, Pauls says there should be no distinctions.ÿ There should be no divisions.ÿ And in Galatiansÿ3:28 he specifically mentions that there should be neither male nor female in Christ. Maybe, by dating, we can learn that people from the opposite sex are just people.ÿ And they have a very different perspective.ÿ They have different attitudes, etc.ÿ They can really be a benefit. <h2>Teaches us to serve</h2> The second good point is that a dating relationship is often the first time someone will learn to care about anyone else besides themselves.ÿ Because if you are going to have a dating relationship of any depth, then you have to start to work on that person.ÿ You have to start becoming concerned about their character and try to change that person and minister to them. And I think this is probably the most positive thing about dating.ÿ Don't just leave that person the same as you found them.ÿ Like I said before, men and women are different and we should have an impact on each other. And I think the opportunity is great because people will listen to someone they are dating before they'll listen to anyone else. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was talking with one girl and she was fuming about her roommates.ÿ ""They're such biÿ.ÿ.ÿ.!""ÿ ""What's the deal?""ÿ ""They had the nerve to call me mopeyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and self-centered!""ÿ ""That really bothered you, huh?""ÿ ""How dare they!ÿ I could just as soon move out as take that kind of crap!""ÿ I had some insight into this situation because I knew her boyfriend real well.ÿ ""Isn't that similar to what your boyfriend was saying just a little while ago?""ÿ ""That's different?""ÿ ""How?""ÿ ""He loves meÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Let's face the facts again.ÿ I'm not saying this is good.ÿ But the fact is, people will take things from someone they are dating. So, the opportunity is to learn for the first time what it means to try and change someone for the better.ÿ This is what we talk about when we use the term ""ministry.""ÿ We're talking about having an impact on someone's character and changing that person in a godly way. One of the most unfortunate things is when people don't take the lessons they learn about service and apply them elsewhereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Teaches us about ourselves</h2> The third great benefit of dating is that it teaches us about ourselves.ÿ When we date someone, we start to see things about our style of relating.ÿ We see how selfish we are. I remember myself dating this Christian girl where it was kind of rough.ÿ But the fact is, I learned so much.ÿ Lesson after lesson. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember this girl would say things like, ""I think we should break up.""ÿ Why?ÿ ""Because I don't know how to treat you right.""ÿ What does that mean?ÿ ""I'm just a terrible personÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ Well, don't you think I should be the one to tell you that?ÿ And it came to light that she was feeling very insecure about the relationship. I learned two things.ÿ For one, I learned that women are manipulative, which we'll talk about in a second.ÿ Number two, I learned that the way I come accross is very harsh.ÿ I come accross like, ""You have to live up to my standard or I'll drop you.ÿ I don't need you.""ÿ And this was an attitude that was effecting all my relationships, not just that one. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Then I remember after a while I didn't feel very excited about the relationship anymore.ÿ I was just kind of ho-hum.ÿ Now you all know that in a dating relationship, nothing could be worse.ÿ But I learned something just by mistake.ÿ I took her out on a date.ÿ Usually, we always went dutch, which I believe is the correct way to go on dates in our day and age.ÿ But on this date I paid.ÿ I laid out about $30 that night!ÿ And you would think, if you know me, that I would be groaning about how much money I spent.ÿ But the truth is, I was more excited about the relationship than I had been in a long, long time. I learned an important lesson there: Your heart follows your investment.ÿ Wherever you invest, you fall in love.ÿ And it's not just money eitherÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In all kinds of ways, you will see people change faster and come to terms with issues quicker when they are dating someone than maybe any other way.ÿ It matters to us.ÿ It's intense. It effects our emotionsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>The dangers of dating</h1> <h2>Defrauding</h2> But then there are the dangers of dating.ÿ And I think that the danger of dating can be seen in the principle Paul cites in IÿThess.ÿ4.ÿ In that passage he is talking about the danger of immorality, or using someone sexually. In v.ÿ6 he says that one of the issues at stake is that people ""defraud"" each other in the matter.ÿ What is it when I defraud someone?ÿ When I defraud someone it is when I con them.ÿ It's when I get something from them by cheating them out of it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I were to try and sell you the Statue of Liberty, that would be defrauding. Defrauding is offering someone something that is not rightly mine to give.ÿ And when we are dating, the greatest danger is insinuating things that we have no right to insinuate.ÿ We do it because we want something--good feelings, sex, a cure for our insecure feelings.ÿ This is where the hurt comes from. Think about defrauding in this way: If I'm not able to commit my life to someone, which is the way it is in dating, then how would I act?ÿ How would I act so that I'm not defrauding that person? Or, to put it another way: If you know that you are going to break up with someone, what things would be inappropriate? This is good insight from Paul here.ÿ Because he knows that this is one of the greatest dangers in male/female relationships.ÿ People defraud each other.ÿ I think it is this that accounts for the hurts people leave behind them when they date. I think we can defraud in a number of ways. <h2>Going for emotional commitment</h2> One way we can defraud is by trying to secure more and more emotional commitment out of someone when the nature of the relationship is just dating. Most of the dating relationships here will break up.ÿ And a lot of them should break up that won't.ÿ But the younger you are, the better chance you have of breaking up. And so, what if you succeed in getting them to say, ""You are the most special one.ÿ You are my everything.ÿ I live for youÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" and then we break up!?ÿ What is the impact of this? Of course it's extreme pain!ÿ It hurts.ÿ Of course this is one of the reasons that people layer mistake on top of mistake and go ahead and get married.ÿ They feel that after all the things that have been said they can't face the pain of letting go. Well, those things shouldn't have been said in the first place.ÿ But even when they are, two errors just make a bigger mess.ÿ You can't put out a fire by spraying gasoline on it.ÿ There are a lot of mistaken marriages that bring a lot of unneccesary pain because people grabbed for too much in the emotional realm. We do these things because we are insecure.ÿ We can't handle just being kind of low key.ÿ We have to heat things up. And the burn is that when we do move on, we tear a lot of that person away because some very serious things have been said.ÿ I believe that even if you make the mistake of saying very serious things about your love for someone or your commitment, when you know that you're not ready to get married to that person, then you should apologize.ÿ We should realize that we were messing with their emotions. Now of course, the other person will not let you apologize because it felt good for them too.ÿ But you have to make a statement that says, ""I do not want things to heat to a boil in the emotional realm here.ÿ It's just not time for that in a dating relationship."" <h2>Too much time</h2> A second, related way of defrauding is spending too much time.ÿ By this I mean that you spend too much time dating.ÿ We'll let the relationship go on and on without deciding wht we're going to do with it. Let me say, there is no way you can date for years and not become deeply intertwined with that other person's emotions.ÿ And then when you finally do rip away?! This can happen for any number of reasons.ÿ But usually it is because neither party wants to face the pain of breaking off the relationship. Let me tell you something about love relationships.ÿ You cannot have them without pain.ÿ We're so insecure we feel like we can't face the prospect of some emotional pain.ÿ ""It's the worst thing you could do to someone!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here's the conversation.ÿ I've re-enacted it dozens of times:ÿ ""Well, you should just break up with her then.""ÿ ""I can't do that!""ÿ ""Why not?""ÿ ""It'll hurt her!""ÿ ""Oh no!ÿ Not pain!!ÿ What could be worse?"" And of course the reason we feel guilty about the pain is because we have been defrauding the person!ÿ We have been commiting ourselves to them by our words, by our sexuality, or by our indecision. If you want to know how it is for me, when I was dating, I could only go for a very few months before I got to the point where I knew, ""I'm going to have to decide either to break this off or pursue something more serious."" And when you reach that point, and you're not seriously ready to pursue a relationship that terminates in marriage, then you are opting for greater pain and emotional turmoil later. And let me add that even if you feel like you are ready to pursue this relationship to the long term, there is still a very high chance that you will break up.ÿ And for that reason, there are still a lot of things that are downright inappropriate to say and do. When you're ready to commit to that person, then you can ask them about it and get engaged.ÿ Then you can start talking about how you want to live your life together, how I've never loved anyone as much asÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Sexual involvement</h2> The third way we defraud I have already mentioned, it's sexual involvement.ÿ And this one is certainly the most damaging and hurtful to people. There is a pressure on in our culture for men to be so persistent and aggressive in the area of sexuality.ÿ For one thing, men are taught from a very young age to equate sexuality with emotional love.ÿ I could go on and on about that.ÿ But sufice it to say, as men, we have a very warped view of love with the opposite sex.ÿ And the result is that men feel it's their job to push for more and more sexual involvement. Women, on the other hand, are not exactly innocent.ÿ The fact is, most women believe that they are in a relationship that could wind up in marriage.ÿ Jeff talked about that last week.ÿ And here's the foolishness: girls will give in to sexual advances or even initiate them, because they believe that the result will be more intimacy and more commitment. There's this romantic ideal where girls believe that they can rope a man in.ÿ ""I'll finally win that man who breaks down and admits `I need you.ÿ I need you like I've never needed anyone!'""ÿ And they're willing to engage in whatever to get to that point. If you rope a man in like that, you are a very stupid person.ÿ I don't know how to say it any kinder.ÿ Because even if you succeed, you did not win that man's love.ÿ You won that man's guilt.ÿ I've talked to man after man who wanted to be able to walk away from a relationship, but they couldn't because now they knew they had used that girl sexually. Nobody wins anyone's heart by manipulation.ÿ And we need to call some of this sexual involvement for what it is: manipulation, defrauding. And as you saw, it upsets God very much. <h1>When we fail: Gospel</h1> And that is the thought I want to conclude on.ÿ I don't want to leave on a negative note. When we fail, in the sexual realm.ÿ And by that I don't mean just that we used someone sexually.ÿ I mean when we fail in our relationships with the opposite sex, it is because of our selfishness.ÿ It is because we are using the opposite sex as a crutch for our own insecurities.ÿ It is because we have no consideration for the pain we cause others. When we fail here, it is a serious thing.ÿ I don't need to point that out to you.ÿ I'll guarentee that some of the most powerful pains we carry with us have to do with our sexuality. But here is the good news: With God, there is forgiveness and healing.ÿ You may not realize this, but the Bible says that ultimately, all the wrongs we commit against others in this area are against him.ÿ They are his people.ÿ He is the one we ultimately hurt and offend. But the Bible says that with God, there is forgiveness and healing like nowhere elseÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03693.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Marriage &amp; Dating - Buck McCallum",

"Human Diversity: We Are Personal",1991-06-02,,"Human Diversity: We Are Personal
<h1>What does it mean to say, ""We are personal""?</h1>
What we are looking at tonight is the issue of our personality, what it is to be personal.ÿ This has a real bearing on the issue of God's plan for our life, because to be personal is to be different.ÿ To be personal is to have characteristics which may make you unique. So we're going to look at this notion of personality--of uniqueness--as a God-given part of our nature. But first I think we need to acknowledge that being unique is not always easy.ÿ We're going to talk about this in a little bit.ÿ But I want to set out the thesis right away that humans put more of a premium on sameness than uniqueness.ÿ It's exactly the opposite of God's design. Example: When you look at this creation and you see insects with periscopes and worms that turn into butterflies, you had better know that we are dealing with a God who loves difference. But we like conformity.ÿ And so this makes dealing with our own uniqueness difficult.ÿ It can be a real struggle, like I went through before I got my nose-job. God is involved in our makeup The first thing we should know about God is that he is intimately involved in our creation and makeup.ÿ This is true for each and every one of us.
<h2>Psa. 139</h2>
A passage I like on this is Psa. 139:13, 14.ÿ This is a passage we looked at a while back when we were talking about science and Christianity.ÿ We noted that there are some scientifically unsound aspects of this statement.ÿ And yet, the point of this statement is not to describe the process of a human incubation.ÿ The point is to describe the fact that God knows us, that God is behind the scenes steering things.ÿ And it also says that God has good intentions for us, reflected in the way we are made.
<h2>Luke 12</h2>
In Luke 12 it tells us something similar.ÿ It tells us that right now, as we stand here, God knows us intimately.
<h1>God is able to do this</h1>
This is in stark contrast to the way things are in the world around us.ÿ And we need to appreciate this.ÿ This is what Jeff talked about last week: God knows you, and me, and the other person.ÿ And God seeks us out.ÿ He knows and seeks out every individual. Think about that!ÿ The big cheese, the biggest cheese, has time for you and me!ÿ This is a lot different from the important people we are familiar with.ÿ They have no time for anyone.ÿ The bigger you are, the less you have to mingle with the little folks. But God is just the opposite.ÿ He is the most important person in the universe, and yet he knows the number of hairs on your head. Obviously, he is different from us.ÿ He has a bigger CPU and is able to handle a mass of data.
<h2>You need to recognize him</h2>
This is the picture of God that the Bible presents.ÿ A God so vast that he creates the universe--one you can't put in a box.ÿ And yet, a God so personal that he wants you.ÿ And he is pursuing you whether you see it or not. Example: I love the way Jesus described God's attitude in Luke 15, where he tells several stories about lost things.ÿ He compares God's search for us to that of a poor person who lost their last coin.ÿ That person would sweep the whole house, move out the furniture, anything until she found that coin. He says, ""That's the way God is about each of us."" I'm going to bet that there are some of us here who have not been seeing his overtures towards us.ÿ There are some of us here who have been ignoring his attempts to get through to us.ÿ And we explain everything away. Maybe it's time to stop that.ÿ Maybe it's time to recognize that God wants to be involved with you and that God wants you.ÿ Maybe it's time to recognize that person who talks to you is from God.ÿ Maybe it's time to recognize those misfortunes are from God, to get your attention.ÿ Maybe it's time to recognize those abilities God has given you are from him and that they have a purpose. Example: Listening to Jeff last week, I remembered one time when the awareness that God was pursuing me broke in on me.ÿ It was both a positive and negative experience.ÿ I had just come home from a very frustrating encounter, when my mother who is a Christian, suggested to me that it was God who made these kinds of things happen.ÿ That thought had been percolating in my head already (as I think all of us like to credit bad things to God).ÿ But when she said that I hit the ceiling, ""I know he is and I wish he would leave me alone!""ÿ Later that night, as I reflected on things.ÿ it occurred to me, ""Why does he take the time?ÿ Why does he bother?""ÿ And I realized that what had made me so angry was actually a sign of love from the personal God. He is involved.ÿ He knows all about you.ÿ The only question is, have you turned to him and acknowledged your need for him.ÿ That's our problem.ÿ We think we can live our lives without him.ÿ And God is waiting for us to get to the point where we humble ourselves before him and admit, ""Yes, I need you.ÿ Yes, I need your forgiveness."" If you want to turn to God here tonight, then you can.ÿ He will hear you.ÿ You can turn to God in your heart and tell him that you need him.ÿ You must tell him that you need his forgiveness for always going your own way and ignoring him. I want to make two further points about our personalness, our uniqueness which is God given.
<h2>A horizontal focus</h2>
One is that even though God is the one who has given us our individuality, we are obsessed with what other people think about it.ÿ We don't even care so much about what the author says about our uniqueness as we are concerned with what other humans will say about it. Example: I have to admit that prior to becoming a Christian I was in bondage.ÿ I was a slave.ÿ Because I would look at other people and say, ""I want to be like that person.""ÿ Or I would even see things about myself and hide them because I thought that they were uncool.ÿ In fact, I have to admit, I'm still embarrassed about some of the unique features God has given me.ÿ Because my focus is not on what God has done, but on what others will think about it. The net result of this way of thinking is a pressure towards sameness.ÿ In each of us, there is a strong tendency to want others to be the same as us.ÿ And this tendency manifests itself on a large scale as a pressure to conform.ÿ When people come together, they start to develop a consensus about what's good and bad.ÿ What is popular and unpopular. Example: This is a problem in the church as well.ÿ It always has been.ÿ There is a passage in I Cor. 12 where Paul has to correct the thinking of the Corinthian church on this score.ÿ They were putting a lot of pressure on people to conform to a certain type of Christian ministry in the church.ÿ And Paul writes and cautions them, ""Hey, the church is supposed to be like a body.ÿ And in a body, you don't have just one eye that rolls around.ÿ In a body, there are different parts.ÿ Each part is unique and plays its role."" So, it is in human nature to pressure one another to conform.ÿ And yet, God has given us a nature that is unique.ÿ The problem is, then, that instead of looking to him and asking, ""What did you have in mind for this?"" we look around us and see what other people think.ÿ I've seen people practically ignore and eliminate what could their most powerful and unique features because they thought others would not like it.ÿ It didn't matter what God had to say about it.ÿ The only thing that mattered was what others had to say. In fact, some of us have gone so far to suppress the unique features of our personality, it's almost like we don't have one, at least on the outside.ÿ That is wrong.ÿ Our job is to find out what God has given us and express it. ÿBut what we find most people doing is bottling it up.ÿ Most people I talk to, in fact, are very out of touch with what it is that God has given them. And if we let him, this is one of the things that God starts to do with us.ÿ He uncorks us and starts to let our unique features show. Example: I was so bottled up myself as a younger Christian.ÿ I was reclusive.ÿ Because what I saw looking out from the inside was that people were uncomfortable talking to me.ÿ And I looked around and saw that they were comfortable talking to each other.ÿ They called each other.ÿ They expressed themselves to naturally to each other.ÿ But with me, people were always more careful.ÿ So the way I took that was that I wasn't liked.ÿ I wasn't as desirable as some folks.ÿ I'll tell you, if I hadn't become a Christian and let God work on me, I would have become a recluse.ÿ Because that was the way I responded to the whole phenomenon.ÿ ""If people don't want to talk to me, then I don't want to talk to them.""ÿ But God, through various means, opened my eyes to the fact that what I actually had in my personality was a character of leadership.ÿ That actually, it wasn't that people were avoiding me.ÿ It was that they were waiting for me to initiate with them.ÿ I gave across an image that that was my role--the initiator, the leader. And that was a God-given aspect of my personality that I would not have discovered if it weren't for him. The problem is that we don't turn to God and hear what he has to say about our character.
<h1>Personalities are personal</h1>
This brings me to my last point about having a distinct personality.ÿ The point is that personalities are personal.ÿ You were designed to personally interact with other people.ÿ That is why you were unique.ÿ It wasn't just so that you could look in the mirror and say, ""Aren't you different!""ÿ It was so that you could make a difference to someone else. We are personal.ÿ We were meant to be personal with other people. This fact about human nature is powerfully depicted in the first story of the Bible.ÿ This is where God creates man.ÿ And God created man first alone.ÿ But he had lots to do.ÿ His environment was perfect.ÿ God saw to it that the first human had access to everything.ÿ And God gave Adam a task, to cultivate and keep the world he lived in.ÿ I'm sure that it was a demanding, yet fulfilling job.ÿ The Bible goes on and on telling us that everything in Adam's world was good. But then the focus come back down to Adam, and the Bible tells us that Adam was lonely (v.16).ÿ Adam was in this perfect world, with lots to occupy him.ÿ Yet he was sad!ÿ Because he was lonely. The Bible is illustrating by story something that we then find throughout the rest of the book: People were created to relate to people. Example: You see it in little kids.ÿ Given the choice of the finest toy money can buy, or another child, which will grab the attention of a kid more?ÿ Even the toys are used as a means to interact with the other kids. Once again, however, here is something we distort and ruin over the course of a lifetime.ÿ Very quickly we begin to build barriers between ourselves and others.ÿ Sometimes this happens very fast. But certainly, over a lifetime, the normal track that people take is to gradually grow more and more alienated from other humans. Some of you are in your teens right now.ÿ And normally, this is an age when we're obsessed with other people, ""How do they look at me?ÿ Do I matter to anyone?"" and these kinds of questions.ÿ We're really exploring our relation to others.ÿ But that starts to dim.ÿ And you'll watch people grow older and more distant from others.ÿ They'll get married.ÿ Focus on a career.ÿ Maybe they'll get a hobby or two.ÿ And they'll gradually retreat from other human beings. And meanwhile, inside, a corresponding unhappiness grows.ÿ A corresponding loneliness grows.ÿ And, perhaps what's worse, a gradual suppression of the personality God gave us.ÿ If it isn't being drawn out by rich interaction with other people, then it atrophies.ÿ And you really see people growing more dull, more bland. Example: I'm sure that this is what people refer to as a mid-life crisis.ÿ It has to lead to a crisis when for years you suppress all that God has given you--a crisis of identity, a crisis of purpose, and so on. So, this is how it is that we find out the uniqueness God has given us.ÿ If you want to discover who you really are, then first turn to God.ÿ If you haven't turned your life over to him. Second, tell him, ""You show me who I am.""ÿ Commit yourself to him in prayer.ÿ ""You show me who you made me to be.ÿ You draw out my personality. Third, bear down on your relationships with other Christians.ÿ Other Christians will be used by God to reveal your strengths and weaknesses.ÿ Your successes and failures with other people will expose who you really are. Example: You'll recall my own struggle with the way people interacted with me.ÿ I would not have found out what I did, nor would I have been delivered from my bondage if I had not been seriously working on my love relationships with other people in the church. In the Bible, God gives us a blueprint for how to get involved with others, how to love others, that you can find nowhere else.ÿ God has the secrets to discovery here and we're going to talk about them next week.","https://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03929.mp3

"Human Diversity: People-Oriented People",1991-06-16,," 4 Types of People Part 1 <h1>Why we need this series: Only God knows people</h1> I wanted to talk about this issue of different types of people falling on the heals of our last series about finding God's will in your life.ÿ Because as we talked about that issue, one of the points that we made was that God's design for us has a lot to do with the type of person we are.ÿ In other words, it has to do with the fact that we are unique and personal. Obvioulsy, if you listened to my teaching of a couple weeks ago on this topic, you would know that I don't believe there are only four types of people.ÿ The great truth that the Bible teaches us is that God is infinitely creative.ÿ God is infinitely creative. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If there were just so many parts, and we tossed them up in the air and let them come down, we would get a lot of combinations.ÿ But there are only so many. Uniqueness, as we discussed a couple weeks ago, is tied to the fact that God is involved with us.ÿ He is involved in our composition, our makeup.ÿ And as the infinitely creative God, he never runs out of ideas. But in this series we can't talk about each and every one of usÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ So, we'll talk about four general, generic pictures.ÿ Because that's another one of the good things about God's creation.ÿ There are unifying themes that run through the things we see. <h2>Only God knows (I Cor. 2)</h2> But first, I want to talk about the reason we go into a study like this.ÿ I want to talk about the reasons you should come and listen carefully as we open up the Bible and talk about the various types of people God has made. Turn with me, if you have a Bible, to the book of IÿCor.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Paul, in this passage, is contrasting the wisdom you can find in the world around us with God's wisdom.ÿ I think that you probably know there is a lot of wisdom to be found out there. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I didn't submit to 4-5 years of torture down at OSU because I thought they were all stupid. But Paul says that God has a wisdom, and it's a wisdom that he calls ""mysterious.""ÿ When something is mysterious, that means that it is hard to understand.ÿ It may even be secret. In fact, Paul goes on to say just how mysterious God's wisdom is.ÿ In v.ÿ9 he says, ""Things whichÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ What he is saying is that all the powers of human observation haven't unlocked God's wisdom.ÿ It is beyond us.ÿ When we look for itÿ.ÿ.ÿ. When we study for itÿ.ÿ.ÿ. When we sit down and just try to imagine itÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>For our gloryÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> But here is something I want you to see about the wisdom God has for us.ÿ Paul says that God reveals it to us, in v.ÿ7, ""for our glory.""ÿ That's such a radical statement, but it probably doesn't hit you like it hits me if you don't understand what the term glory means. When you glorify something, you bring out its true value.ÿ You draw out its true nature.ÿ You expose it for what it is. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You could actually glorify something negatively.ÿ If I glorified violence I might hit you to show you what it's like.ÿ I might show you bloody pictures.ÿ Somehow I would communicate the nature of violence. But here's the point of this passage: God reveals his wisdom to us for our glory!ÿ He reveals his wisdom to us so that we can become who we were really meant to be.ÿ He wants to draw out our true nature.ÿ He wants to glorify us. Now the reason that this so much shocks me is because we always picture things the other way around.ÿ Ask yourself, ""Why did God give us the Bible?""ÿ And the usual answer that comes to our minds is something like, ""Because he wanted us to behave.""ÿ ""He wanted us to understand him better."" Whatever reason comes to our minds, it probably isn't, ""He wanted to give us the secrets we need to really blossom.ÿ He wanted to give us the secrets we need to become the people we were meant to be."" That's not what comes to our minds, but there it is in the Bible.ÿ This is <strong>the basic misunderstanding</strong> that people have about God.ÿ I will guarentee you that if you are here tonight investigating God and Christianity, somewhere in your mind is the notion that ""maybe it's the right thing to do to get into God.ÿ But at what price!ÿ How much of my freedom will I lose?ÿ What kind of weirdo will I become?"" And it is like eating oatmealÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Only with God</h2> And once again, I emphasize, it is only from God that we can find the real scoop. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: That scientist, who can figure out many of the secrets of the physical universe, still can't put together a successful family without God.ÿ We probably all feel like our families are OK.ÿ But I'll tell you, when you look at it from God's perspective--what could have been--our families are turning out insecure people.ÿ Our families are producing people who can't relate to other people.ÿ Our families are producing people who don't understand themselves or their potential, damaged peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: That psychologist, as much as he knows about human responses, can't figure out the meaning of his life without God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: That historian, as much as he understands about the cause and effects of the past, can't help himself from comitting the same errors himself! This is why we need to listen carefully as we talk about four different types of people.ÿ For one, God has the keys to your own personal life.ÿ But at the same time, he has the keys to understanding other peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>We need to benefit from others</h1> As we talk about each of the four types of people, one understanding I am going to repeat again and again is that we need the others.ÿ What I mean is that we need the types of people that aren't like us. We need them not only as friends, so that we have different types of people in the world.ÿ But we also need to learn from them.ÿ When someone is different than me, I usually judge them.ÿ But if I'm especially generous, I say that we need people like that in the world. But what I'm telling you here is that we need to go further even than that.ÿ We need to say, ""I need to become like that.""ÿ Part of your growth as a person in this life is to get up next to people who are different than you and learn from them.ÿ Obviously, we will never become clones of one another.ÿ But we should begin to pick up one another's traits to some extent, at least the good ones. So, principle number one from God's wisdom is, emulate the godly character you see in others.ÿ Don't just look and say, ""That's nice.""ÿ Try to do it like they do it. The Bible is real strong on this as a way of life for wise people. <h2>Prov. 27:17</h2> As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. Here is a verse that typifies the attitude God has towards our differences.ÿ Instead of being irritated by the people who are greatly differen than us, we need to allow them to sharpen us. <h2>Phil.ÿ3:17</h2> Paul is outright about this truth, as he knows that he has learned a lot from others, and he has the ability to teach quite a bit as well.ÿ This is why there are several passages in the NT where he actually encourages people to immitate him. Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you. This is not some egotistical high that Paul is on.ÿ He knows that this is the way God works.ÿ He works on me through the differences in others.ÿ So, Paul is saying that there are aspects of his character that are worthy of imitation.ÿ ""Go ahead and do what I do,"" he says. <h2>Ecclesiastes 4:12, 13</h2> Then there are a series of verses in the book of Ecclesiastes that talk about people needing other people, and the haughtiness of the person who believes he is complete. Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. He is saying that the more we depend on each other, the stronger we are.ÿ Likewise, in the next verse, Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take instruction. Here is the definition of the fool, someone who feels he no longer needs the instruction others can give. Ironically, this is an attitude that people in our culture believe should be sought after.ÿ To reach the point where you are an authority, to reach the point where you don't need to grovel before other people to get their input, that's the goal! These verses immediately follow a verse that has been used before on Christian datesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Summary</h2> So here's God's secret on how to deal with people who are different than us.ÿ It's a secret because our pride and our self-centeredness tell us exactly the opposite.ÿ ""Judge people who are different than me.ÿ Make them change.ÿ Get irritated with them."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This is the single biggest problem that comes up in marriages.ÿ Couples are so busy trying to change the other person, they forget that's not what they're there for.ÿ You're not there to change the other person.ÿ You're there to get changed by that person! <h1>The people person</h1> I'm going to talk real briefly about the people oriented person tonight.ÿ I wish we had more time to talk about this, but our introduction to this topic was necessarily long.ÿ So that leaves us just a short time to get involved with this type. <h2>Definition</h2> What I mean by a people oriented person is someone who enjoys people.ÿ We all enjoy people to one extent or another, but this type really gets energy from people.ÿ When this person comes home from a part full of people, he is on a roll.ÿ ""Man was that great!"" We're not all this way, are we?ÿ Some of us look at other people as an expense rather than a dividend.ÿ We see a room full of people and say, ""Oh man, where am I going to get the energy for all this?"" <h2>Barnabas</h2> There are a number of examples of this type of person in the Bible.ÿ But one that I like is Barnabas.ÿ He is found in the book of Acts.ÿ And from the first moment you meet him, he is into people.ÿ People are his life and they matter to him more than almost anything. <h3>Acts 4:36, 37</h3> The first place we meet Barnabas is in Actsÿ4.ÿ The story is that thousands of people are becoming Christians.ÿ In fact, it just so happens that after Christ raised from the dead and ascended to heaven, there was a massive pilgramige to Jerusalem for another religious feast.ÿ And this is the context in which Christianity got started.ÿ The first apostles preached the good news of JC to these throngs of people. So, thousands of them are coming to know Christ personally.ÿ And it's interesting that Barnabas is the first one of these that we meet up close.ÿ Luke tells us a couple things about him, Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement),ÿ sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet. First, he tells that Barnabas was already known for his encouragement.ÿ This is one of the earmarks of a people person <strong>when they are following God's way</strong>.ÿ They encourage people. Encouragement is a little different than what you and I might think.ÿ It's not just when you go up and say, ""Hey, you're alright!""ÿ It's much more than that.ÿ When you encourage someone, according to the Bible, you motivate them.ÿ You motivate them to action.ÿ You motivate them to change. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was reminded about how important this kind of thing was when a woman I have known for years told me the real impact I had on her, ""You made me feel like I could.""ÿ That's encouragement.ÿ That was a reminder to me about one of the most important aspects of our work with each other. Anyone who knows me can tell you that doesn't come naturally to me.ÿ We need to learn this from people-oriented people. Probably a lot of us here can remember the precise words someone used to motivate us at one point or another. Luke also tells us that Barnabas gave.ÿ He gave because some people had tremendous need.ÿ Because so many people were coming to Christ, there were a lot of them who were just there for the jewish festival and wound up getting persuaded by the Christian message.ÿ So there was this great need that Barnabas saw for some generosity. Here again is one of the earmarks of a people person when they are letting God have his way with them.ÿ They look to give.ÿ And the great thing about this type of person is that they will be moved by the needs of others to sacrifice. It's so different than some of us.ÿ Some of us are sold on a great idea.ÿ Some of us have projects.ÿ But this person sees personal needs and sacrifices to meet them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: <h2>Barnabas went on</h2> Barnabas went on from here and grew.ÿ He grew to the point that Luke, the author of Acts, holds him up as a model of how a Christian should grow and serve.ÿ I wish we had time to go into all the descriptions Luke gives us of this man.ÿ But suffice it to say that later in life, he became one of the greatest worldwide church planters of the era, having a worldwide impact for Christ. But he started as a people person, doing what he does best--encouraging and giving for the personal needs of others. <h2>People-love gone astray</h2> As I've talked about Barnabas, I've emphasized that he was the way he was because he let God have his way with him.ÿ He let God change him. That is the key opperative here.ÿ Because God has the secrets to develop a person like Barnabas. You see, the normal route that a people person takes is to enjoy people, yes.ÿ But what we do is that we warp that tendency.ÿ We twist it to our own selfish ends. What happens is that people are a turn-on for the people person.ÿ But instead of taking that God-given enjoyment of people and using it to serve them, we will look at people as objects to take from.ÿ ""Turn me on,"" is the attitude we're talking about here. You'll see one of these types who hasn't been changed by God yet, and instead of excited by people and encouraging them, they will actually be bored by people!ÿ They'll be looking around thinking, ""Who's going to stimulate me?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have one friend who is a great people person.ÿ She exemplifies quite a few of these positive traits.ÿ But she also shows some of the negative still.ÿ And if she is hanging around people and they aren't just stimulating enough, she'll go to sleep right there!ÿ Sitting in a chair! And you can sometimes sense this tendency in someone as a subtle--sometimes not so subtle--demand for attention.ÿ A demand for stimulation, now! A love of people, gone astray. God's secret, if he can have his way, is to turn this kind of person into the kind of person who engergizes the people around him.ÿ The kind of person where we feel like, ""Oh, where is he?ÿ We need him around here for some of that positive stuff he gives us!"" I'm going to finish up on this topic next week and talk about the next type of person, the task oriented person.ÿ But I want to save some of the practicals on how we can become an exciting, life-giving people person rather than just a sponge. Lemmon juice with worch. sauce and tobasco, marinate the fish.ÿ After marinade, put in a flower and salt batter (little salt).ÿ After dipping in flour, put in an egg ""wash"" (milk and egg).ÿ Then he has a mixture of parmisian cheese and sesame seed.ÿ The fillets go in that next.ÿ Then fry them as usual.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03931.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Human Diversity - Buck McCallum",
"Human Diversity: Goal-Oriented People",1991-06-23,,"  <h1>People-oriented person, cont.</h1> I said last week that I wanted to give a few conclusions about the people oriented person.ÿ I wanted to talk about making the transition from being self-centered to being others-centered.ÿ Because that is the real treasure of the people-oriented person--when they become truly others-centered instead of being a sponge, taking from people. <h2>What is a sponge?</h2> Some of you last week were wondering about this notion of a people-person becoming a ""sponge"", in that I said that without God's help, a people oriented person will look at other people as a source to take from.ÿ Naturally, they have this tremendous attraction to people.ÿ But when that goes astray, as it always does apart from God, they will look at people as a source of selfish stimulation.ÿ Their motto is, ""Turn me on."" I don't want you to get the impression that the people person is any more selfish than anyone else.ÿ They're not.ÿ It's just that when a people person is selfish, they turn to other people to take from.ÿ Someone else may withdraw from people.ÿ Another person may use people as tools.ÿ But the people person gets hungry for stimulation from other people. <h2>Why are people selfish?</h2> Now when I use this term, ""selfish,"" you should understand that every human suffers from it. The Bible is real clear that people in this world are self-centered.ÿ I don't mean to say that we never notice anyone.ÿ I don't mean to say that we don't care about anyone else.ÿ What I mean to say is that the reason we care about people and the reason we notice others is because it somehow benefits us. I am the boss of my life.ÿ I call the shots.ÿ If I get to a point with anything where the costs outweigh the benefits, I move along. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Take something as absolutely bizarre as an abusive relationship.ÿ Why does someone stay in one of these?ÿ It's because they perceive a benefit.ÿ If they didn't, they would move on.ÿ They want something too.ÿ And that's where we get terms like, ""co-dependant."" The only freedom from that, the Bible tells us, is when we meet God.ÿ When we meet God, then we can serve another master besides ourselves.ÿ Not a master who is warped and twisted like ourselves.ÿ Not a master who can't see beyond the end of his nose.ÿ Not a master who is self-serving like us.ÿ The loving authority of God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Jesus said, ""If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.ÿ Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."" He is saying, as he does in many places, that he is the one who has the keys to freedom. Of course, this is what scares us about God.ÿ We're afraid of the fact that he is an authority, that he wants to have a say in our lives.ÿ But this is why I am doing this series.ÿ It's to show that God doesn't hurt us.ÿ God sets us free.ÿ God is the one, as we talked about last week, who has the secrets that we are desparate for.ÿ He has the key to unlock human behavior and potential. In this matter of the people-person, he is the one who can free us from the self-centered perspective that we talked about last week.ÿ And it is something that we should want to be freed from too.ÿ When you are self centered, people notice it.ÿ It makes people back away. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I had a friend who was a people person, but he had let selfishness reign in his life to the point that he viewed people as the total source of life.ÿ And it just so happened that this guy was real hugry.ÿ He was the kind of guy who would come up to you and you knew, ""Man, this guy's gonna cost!""ÿ And it was a drag.ÿ And so what happened?ÿ People ran away.ÿ And he was more hungry.ÿ So the next time he would be foaming at the mouthÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is an extreme cycle.ÿ But it is being played out at greater and lesser extents all over.ÿ Being our own boss is not fulfilling.ÿ We think it is but it's not.ÿ God has a better way. <h2>A relationship with God</h2> Someone mentioned last week that a relationship with God is where things really get going for a POP.ÿ I agree.ÿ That has to be the place to start. By a relationship with God I mean that you come to God in humility and admit that you need him.ÿ Which is just the opposite attitude that we all start with.ÿ You come to God and admit that you need his forgiveness.ÿ You need him and you don't deserve it.ÿ This is the humble attitude God is looking for. And God will go from there and begin a relationship with you.ÿ This is the part that's scary.ÿ Because we are all afraid of what God is going to do.ÿ But listen, you have to be ready to believe that God is good.ÿ We can't go any further without that. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There are always things about my character that God is working on.ÿ But one issue that has stricken me lately is the matter of control.ÿ It's an issue that seems so innocent.ÿ Because I want to have control of things for very good reasons.ÿ And yet, God takes issue with me on this.ÿ He brings it up because that issue of control is just another way we play God in our own lives and in the lives of others.ÿ Well, that's real scary to me.ÿ If I give up control, that's to trust someone else.ÿ Something as simple as doing things my wife's way as opposed to mine.ÿ But ultimately, it's not a matter of trusting my wife or any other human.ÿ It's a matter of trusting God.ÿ I have to pray and read the scriptures to get it in my mind that the one calling for this change is the God who loves me. So, you have a relationship with God.ÿ And you know what?ÿ God wants to be the source of a lot of what you were looking for in other people.ÿ God is a person.ÿ And he wants a relationship where he can provide you with energy, stimulation, comfort, all the things that you were looking for from others. <h2>Give what you want</h2> Secondly, as a people person, you have a knack that maybe none of the others of us have as much.ÿ You know what people really want from people.ÿ You want it so much yourself.ÿ You know exactly what it is that people want from other people.ÿ It's what you crave. So, you're in a unique position to give that to people.ÿ This is what I was driving at last week.ÿ The people person can become the person among us who is a real turn-on.ÿ They are positive.ÿ They can be encouragingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I had a friend who became a Christian.ÿ And I saw at one point that he was getting frustrated with his Christian experience.ÿ He was in a real dry and frustrating phase.ÿ I suggested to him, ""Why don't you try to get invovled in a couple people's live here and serve them.ÿ You know, get in there and share God's love with them.""ÿ He said, ""I'm a real young Christian.ÿ I wouldn't know how to do that.""ÿ ""Just give them the same things that turn you on.""ÿ To this day, even though I don't see him that much anymore, what I do hear is that when people get with him, they are uplifted, inspired. On the other hand, I can warn you.ÿ If you are a people person, and you don't learn to give to people in the areas you hunger, you will have a very, very frustrated Christian experience.ÿ Give to people, in the very areas you are hungry. <h1>The goal oriented person</h1> The next person I want to talk about is the goal-oriented person, or the task-oriented person. <h2>Who they are</h2> As the people person gets off on people, the GOP gets his happiness or fulfillment from setting and achieving goals.ÿ They like to accomplish things. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I feel some affinity with this type of person.ÿ And it's not uncommon for me to lie awake at night thinking of some project.ÿ I'll be visualizing how I could do it better and faster. Once again, not all of us are this way.ÿ Not all of us would be so excited about a project that we can't fall asleep.ÿ Not all of us would go the the library and check out books on how to do something better.ÿ Not all of us would get so focused on accomplishing a project that we would forget to eat, go without sleep and certainly without human contact, all in order to finish. <h2>How we need them</h2> Sometimes we can feel like this type of pretty weird.ÿ They can be unsocial, which they are.ÿ They can seem obsessed with their own thing, which they are.ÿ They can appear to view people around them as project, or evaluate people by how well they fit into plans, which they do. Yet, this kind of person, if God can have his way, is indispensible to us.ÿ This kind of person can motivate us to action, like perhaps no other.ÿ And accomplishing things, is, by the way, one of the great ways God has given us to be fulfilled in this life.ÿ I don't think it is by any means the only way, as some do.ÿ But if you look at the Bible, you will see that achieving and accomplishing is one of the great ways God has given us for fulfillment. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We don't have to turn there, but one of the ways that Jesus appealed to the disciples to follow him, forsaking everything, was by way of a task.ÿ ""Come on,"" he said, ""I'll make you fishers of men.""ÿ And he told them that he was going to give them the power to have worldwide impact. Some of you are not accomplishing very much.ÿ You're not achieving very much.ÿ And that in itself is enough to lead to a lot of unhappiness.ÿ If you're not able to look at your life and see yourself accomplishing things, then you know that things aren't right. And it's here that we can learn from a GOP. <h2>The danger of using people</h2> And of course, this is where the real danger of the GOP is: He can tend to value things more than people.ÿ People can become nothing more than pieces of his plan to get something done. In fact, the normal development of this type of person is that they become more and more socially estranged.ÿ It's not that they don't like people or something.ÿ It's that people are a detraction, they take work.ÿ And when you start to get obsessed with your own plans and your own goals, you don't want any such distractions--unless of course they happen to fit in.ÿ This is why people feel used by this sort. And the really dangerous part of it all is that the GOP can become used to being more or less estranged from people.ÿ Now, I don't want to say that they become happy with it.ÿ You can never be happy if you don't deeply emerse yourself in people.ÿ We'll talk about that in a bit.ÿ But there is a phenomenon, whereby a GOP can grow comfortable with a relative state of loneliness.ÿ He just focuses on his goalsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. It's not a happy state, just a comfortable one. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was talking once to an Air Force Colonel who had been shot down and taken prisoner over Viet Nam.ÿ In the years he was in prison, one of the things he had to go through was being chained to the floor for days on end, in his own excriment.ÿ What he told me was that you can kind of wiggle around and get comfortable.ÿ There are ways to get comfortable there.ÿ But you never actually feel good. This is the most dreadful of all conditions.ÿ When you can wriggle around and somehow get comfortable with a state that is actually horrible, that's bad.ÿ That's real bad. Without a doubt, the GOP has to take as a first measure in his relationship with the Lord to pray that he is never comfortable with just achieving goals.ÿ ""God, never let me be happy, or even close, with just acheiving goals."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've prayed this to God.ÿ And I thank him that what he has given me is a strong dose of introspection.ÿ It comes across to some people as depression.ÿ But I'll tell you, if I didn't have it, I would be lost to this world.ÿ You certainly wouldn't see me doing something this sociable--talking to crowds of people.ÿ I'll wake up first things in the morning, ""You're lonely.ÿ You're way out of touch with people.ÿ You spent the whole night with so and so last night and didn't even get personal.""ÿ And the conviction just settles in on me like a weight.ÿ If I didn't have that, I would just pop up and go get 'em with another goal! And I would grow comfortable with something that is ultimately destructive. Pray to God tonight that he won't let you grow comfortable with whatever problem you have.ÿ Even if it isn't the GOP problem.ÿ Pray to him that you will feel uneasy, heavy hearted, weighed down, until you come to terms with it.ÿ I know that if you pray that prayer in sincerity, God will answer it. <h2>People are the real meaning of life</h2> The person I want to look at when it comes to this type is Paul the apostle.ÿ I want to look at Paul because somehwere along the line, he had some major victory over the things we are talking about.ÿ He learned to love people. Let's look at a couple passages <h2>I Cor. 9:24-27</h2> First, let's be real clear that Paul was this type.ÿ There is a passage in IÿCor.ÿ9 where Paul compares his life to a race at the Olympic games.ÿ In v.ÿ24 he says, Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air.ÿ No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize. Only a GOP would describe his life with this kind of analogy.ÿ And Paul does this all over the place.ÿ ""Crush the enemy, achieve victory, pursue the goal."" <h2>I Thess. 2:7, 8</h2> But there was something about Paul that is very different.ÿ Look with me at a passage in IÿThess, But we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.ÿ We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us. These are not the words of a pure GOP.ÿ This man has been changed to the point that he is talking about taking time out to tenderly love people.ÿ If you know anything about a monther's love for a child, it's (normally at least) not so that they can use that child for something purpose or goal.ÿ That love is an end in itself. And Paul is saying, ""You guys mean a lot to me."" <h2>I Cor. 13</h2> And of course if you read Paul's chapter on love, you couldn't find a better refined perspective on loving other people.ÿ It's the one that you find hanging on kitchen walls, etc.ÿ ""Love is patient, love is kindÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" But it's the way Paul starts off that amazes me, If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Here he lists all these accomplishments like having all knowledge.ÿ And he says, ""It's nothing.ÿ Compared to love it's nothing."" This is a transformation.ÿ This is a transformation of character, where God took a man whose natural instinct was to be obsessed with goals.ÿ And he turned him into a person whose goals revolve around people.ÿ In other words, God used that goal orientation to turn Paul into the kind of man who loved people with a vengance.ÿ He loved people ferociously. The love of people became his goal. <h1>Our culture</h1> I want to drop a note here about our culture.ÿ Our culture is a warping, twisting place to live.ÿ This notion, that to enjoy and love people is a goal, is lost on our culture. We toss around slogans like, ""Family matters most to me!""ÿ Or, ""What I really care about is people, most of all!"" But that's not what happens in real life.ÿ Whether we're GOP's or not, our primary value is not relationships with other people. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Our idea of a good social time is going to a movie together. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We spent family time together and watched TV.ÿ And if you ever tried anything else, ""Oh, disgust me!""ÿ Imagine sitting around and just talking with your family! I don't know.ÿ Maybe I came from a weird part of the world.ÿ But I don't think so.ÿ You may fight with your family.ÿ But you don't just sit there and say, ""So, how are you doing?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Or, if you're really a ""social butterfly,"" then you can go to a bar and act completely false for a night.ÿ You can pretend to be someone you aren't!ÿ But at least you're doing it with a bunch of other pretenders, so it's social. The plain fact is, we are a very alienated culture.ÿ The centerpiece of a person's life is work, career.ÿ A woman, or a man for that matter, these days is made to feel guilty if she decides that she wants to focus on family. It is actually revered if a young scholar or sports-figure forsakes all his personal relationships and his personal development to completely fixate on some goal.ÿ That's great!ÿ And we'll do a human interest story on it! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Think of this. When was the last time you sat down with a friend and said, ""So, how have you been feeling?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Go beyond that.ÿ If you say that you are all about people and caring for people.ÿ When was the last time you talked to someone about how you make them feel?ÿ ""So, how have I made you feel lately?"" To most folks that's just a downright bizarre question!ÿ And yet, to not be talking in those terms indicates that there is a distance there, an alienation. Our culture is a warping and twisting environment.ÿ But God wants to change that. <h2>Pray that he won't let you rest easy</h2> <h2>Set specific goals with people</h2> The kinds of goals should be along these lines: How can I effect their feelings? I say that because a GOP would normally set goals like, ""He needs to be changed here and thereÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ That's great.ÿ Do that too.ÿ But set specific goals to effect people's feelings. <h2>Let conviction sink in</h2> Most important, after a night with people, sit back and evaluate what happened.ÿ This introspection is so important.ÿ Sit back and ask, ""How did I make this person feel?"" If you're confused, then you need to start asking questions of people who aren't.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03932.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Human Diversity - Buck McCallum",
"Human Diversity: How to Develop Relationships",1991-07-07,,"  Getting Close <h1>Intro: Concluding the series</h1> We've been talking about different kinds of people for the last several weeks.ÿ People who like peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And this is great, because people are still the best thing going.ÿ There's been a lot of competition lately.ÿ But I still think there is a general consensus that people are the most important thing in life. <h2>People are alienated</h2> It's kind of too bad, in that light, that people are so alienated from each other.ÿ It's too bad that people are so distant.ÿ I mean, if it matters so much, it's too bad that we can't get it together here. I've seen so many signs of alienation in my life, a lack of honesty, a fear of broaching topics, etc. I've come to see that is the rule.ÿ It is not the exception.ÿ People live in different states of distance from one another, even people in families and people who are married. <h2>Examples that show alienation</h2> <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was talking to another friend, who had been talking to one of his friends.ÿ ""He told me he had been real depressed lately.""ÿ ""Really?ÿ Did you ask him why?""ÿ ""Well, no.""ÿ ""Wait a minute!ÿ A guy was sharing with you that he was real depressed lately, and you didn't ask why?!"" What is this?ÿ This is uncomfortability.ÿ This is distance.ÿ Something vulnerable comes up, something close to the heart, and people don't want to mess with it too much.ÿ It's scary.ÿ But it's a sign of distance. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here's another conversation I've had more than once.ÿ ""She's been avoiding me lately.""ÿ ""Well, have you expressed to her that you miss her and feel less close than usual?""ÿ ""Well, no.ÿ Not really.ÿ I've just been avoiding her too.""ÿ Now that's effective! We see things in people that we think we know the interpretation for--a look, a motion, a comment.ÿ And instead of talking about it and what it means, keep it to ourselves and let alienation build. These kinds of things are happening in relationships all across this room. <h2>People who live in chronic alienation</h2> Then there's all the other stuff that is just chronic.ÿ It's not a matter of a relationship getting worse.ÿ It's just that things have never been there to begin with.ÿ Some of us are chronically distant from people. You know one of the greatest signs of chronic distance between yourself and other people?ÿ Yes, maybe there's a sense of loneliness.ÿ That might be noticeable.ÿ But one of the greatest signs is a lack of energy, a lack of drive.ÿ A listlesness. I know that there are some people among us who can compensate for that emptiness by an extreme goal orientation.ÿ They can achieve this, and as soon as they're finished they move on to the next thing.ÿ But, there is no doubt, the emptiness will catch up.ÿ It's just a question of time. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: That loneliness is like the vulture circling overhead, waiting till we finally fall down.ÿ It'll be there. But there are those of us who have learned to exist with loneliness.ÿ We have learned to live with distance and alienation in our lives.ÿ This is scary. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember a time in my life which I call ""The Lonely Summer.""ÿ It was really a fascinating time in retrospect.ÿ Most of you might think of me as kind of an active person, maybe even a sociable person.ÿ But not always so.ÿ In the lonely summer, I didn't have one real friend.ÿ I didn't get desparate about it.ÿ I didn't go seeking some replacement thrill as I have at other times.ÿ Instead, I just resigned myself to loneliness and boredom.ÿ I would wake up in the morning and watch Wild Wild West, followed by the Brady Bunch, and a few other meaningless shows.ÿ I was so totally commited to nothingness, I even watched game shows like ""The Price is Right!"" I learned an interesting lesson that summer.ÿ It is possible to just exist.ÿ Nothing more.ÿ Just exist.ÿ It is possible to drag yourself to the things you have to do.ÿ It is possible to get them done because you just have to.ÿ It is possible to be so withdrawn and lonely that you just don't care anymore. Some of us here may think that our problem is something like, ""I have a drug problem.""ÿ Or, ""I have a habbit I can't quit.""ÿ I'll tell you what is more likely that anything.ÿ You are distant from other humans. These other things are just symptoms. <h2>Man's purpose</h2> This is expressed a number of ways in the Bible.ÿ An example I have brought up here recently is that of Adam, the first man recorded in the Bible.ÿ The Bible tells us a story of God creating Adam, and giving him the whole earth to work with and accomplish things.ÿ And the story goes a long way to establish that everything in this world was great.ÿ The food was great.ÿ The place was great.ÿ But the punch-line is that God looks down and sees, Adam is lonely. None of the other things will satisfy.ÿ The only answer is to have human companionship.ÿ Humans were made for human companionship. This is also expressed in I Cor.ÿ13, where Paul goes through a list of things that he could have.ÿ And the list is pretty impressive.ÿ We looked at it a couple weeks ago.ÿ But let's look at it again for a reminder: If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. ""I am nothing.""ÿ That's the feeling that resonates in the soul of a person who does not have real, intimate human contact.ÿ It is a reality of human existance.ÿ We need intimate contact with other humans in order to be healthy and whole. <h2>Summary</h2> Well, we could go on.ÿ If you know that you struggle with alienation with people, then you will benefit from what we are going to say here.ÿ If you don't, if you think that you have great relationships, then maybe you won't.ÿ But then again, maybe you'll be surprised later on. I want to get on to the issue at hand, bringing people together, and not just in some superficial way, but real human contact. I said I had four things I wanted to talk about.ÿ But as I worked on these, I had to cut the list to three because of time.ÿ The issue at hand is obviously complex enough and deep enough that we could talk about a dozen dozen things.ÿ But I picked these three issues because I thought that we could benefit from them the most now. <h1>Emotion</h1> The first big issue I want to touch on is the issue of emotion.ÿ Now I don't want to spend a lot of time here because in the course of this series we have already talked about an emotional impact a couple times. One of the things I did not talk about at the time was the issue of why it is that feelings are so important.ÿ This has been a struggle for me.ÿ And I'm sure I'm not alone on that issue. Why is it important to effect someone's feelings?ÿ And why is it important to allow your feelings to be effected by someone else? <h2>Feelings are vulnerable</h2> The biggest reason that emotions are important in human intimacy is because emotions are at the heart of our vulnerability.ÿ That is where we can be pierced through.ÿ That's where we're soft. That's why we spend so much time building barriers and defenses for our emotions.ÿ In this life, survival is often measured in how effective your barriers are.ÿ But, as long as you live behind those barriers, no one will come in contact with you.ÿ As long as you are hiding this most vulnerable side of yourself, people will not touch you. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Buck, it was great spending time with your sarcasm today!ÿ Maybe we can do it another time! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Hey, it was great spending time with your silence and your expressionless rubber face today! And if you want to talk about knowing, feeling, experiencing real human contact, then you are talking about opening this soft area to another person. There are a number of biblical examples of this type of relationship.ÿ Jesus had it with some of the disciples.ÿ The Bible describes them hugging and weeping together. Peter instructs us to love each other emotionally in IÿPet.ÿ1:22. Since you have purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart. Paul also opened himself up this way, as we noted a couple weeks ago. ÿHe talked about tenderly caring for people, being anxious for them.ÿ There are numerous occasions that Paul talks about the emotional impact that others had on him, how he longed for their presence, to be close to them, how he missed them, how he was broken-hearted at their absence. There is no doubt that opening up this area of our lives is an essential ingredient of really getting close to another person. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've always been amazed at people who tell me that they've never had a problem with relationships.ÿ ""I've been close to my buds all my life!ÿ We work together.ÿ We go to school together.ÿ We do everything together!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Look, when you are driving down a country road and you see a herd of cattle all hanging around, those cows are not close. But if you want to be close, then you have to intentionally work at exposing this area to another person.ÿ You could be with someone 24 hours a day and still feel lonely.ÿ You could go through all kinds of experiences and still feel distant. But we tell ourselves that it will work for us.ÿ ""All I have to do is be with this person and it will be OK."" <h2>Be intentional</h2> So, that is the first principle of vulnerability in emotions: Be intentional.ÿ It's not enough to just affect each other's emotions.ÿ The fact is, we do this to each other all the time without really acknowledging it.ÿ People affect me emotionally.ÿ They don't even have to be close to do that.ÿ In order to have a close relationship, you have to concsiously sharpen your effect on the other person.ÿ You have to openly work on honing your abilities to effect the person you are close to. In short, what this means is talking about how you affect each other.ÿ You have to get it out on the table, ""I would like to have this or that effect on you.""ÿ You have to tell the person about how you feel about them.ÿ And you also have to tell them how you would like to make them feel.ÿ Be up front. Then you have to go beyond that.ÿ You have to consciously sharpen your ability to effect the other person and vice-versa.ÿ Once again, this means talking about it.ÿ ""This is how you affect me.ÿ How do I affect you?""ÿ ""How did I make you feel whenÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ?"" The point is to consciously be working at affecting each other's emotions for the good.ÿ I'm talking about a regular time when you do this.ÿ This is vulnerability.ÿ You are openly admitting that you want this person to affect your emotions and you want to effect theirs.ÿ And you each know, ""This other person is trying to do this."" When you start doing this, you know you are getting in touch with another person. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: After you have a talk with a girl about how you feel about each other, how do you feel?ÿ After you share your feelings on how you have been affecting each other, how does it feel? Why is this?ÿ It's because you really touched another human being.ÿ You really had some emotional interaction with another human.ÿ There is nothing so powerful as this.ÿ There is nothing so invigorating as having an encounter with another person as real and as deep as this. And it doesn't and shouldn't be limited to exchanges with the opposite sex.ÿ This is something we should strive to experience with the same sex. <h2>Aim low, build slow</h2> The second thing I want to say about emotions is, aim low and build slow.ÿ What I'm saying is that in the emotional realm, our goal is not to go get a charge out of someone.ÿ Those are not primarily the emotions we want to work on. The high intensity emotions are great.ÿ And we should experience them with people.ÿ But, that's not the stuff that fuels a relationship over the long term.ÿ In fact, without question, relationships that are built on the big-bang are short lived. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I was a kid I used to ladle sugar onto my Cheerios.ÿ Sometimes I would put it on about a quarter inch thick!ÿ This is hard to believe but true!ÿ That was my after school snack.ÿ And since it was an after school snack, I was looking for that thrill.ÿ I was looking for that thing that would taste so yummy, it would make me feel good after a day at school. People are like that sometimes in the area of emotions.ÿ People are looking for a high, a fix, a jolt.ÿ And, just like a sugar diet will eventually kill you, so will an obsession with the maximum turn-on.ÿ If that's what you're hunting for in relationships, you will always burn out on them.ÿ Because there is a limit to the thrill you can get from a person.ÿ And when you're looking for stimulation, and you reach that limit, then what?ÿ I'll tell you what.ÿ You get bored! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I didn't always put a quarter inch of sugar on my Cheerios.ÿ It started off with a srpinkling.ÿ But over the course of time, it got to outrageous proportions. What I'm saying is that long-term, really fullfilling human contact is built on the more subtle emotions.ÿ Some of us may not even know what that means.ÿ But it includes things like loyalty, an interest in that person, a desire just to hang out--to be with that person. These are all low-key, non-thrilling, basics.ÿ But they are the meat and potatoes of emotional relationships. So, if you learn to live on these and express them, then the sugar will be a treat.ÿ The high-intensity emotions will be the treat that they were meant to be. <h1>Honesty</h1> The second issue I want to discuss is honesty. Some of you think--I know some of you think--that you are going to get close enough to another person without really being honest. Let me assure you, you will fail.ÿ You will always fail.ÿ You will always be at some distance with others. People in the counseling field and the medical field tell us that there is no greater source of mental and perhaps even physical ailment than a lack of honesty.ÿ Notice I didn't say, ""lying.""ÿ Because this is the way we always rationalize things.ÿ ""Well, I don't lie to people.""ÿ That's not the point.ÿ The point here is to be honest with one another. The Bible confirms that dishonesty wears on a person.ÿ Last week we talked about Psa.ÿ32, in connection with David's conscience.ÿ But if we read on, we find this, Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.ÿ When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. That's powerful imagery.ÿ ""My bones wasted away.""ÿ It was a feeling of weakness that went right down to his bones.ÿ Every chair he saw he wanted to flop down into it. The Bible also acknowledges the need for honesty between each other, so that we can encourage and help each other.ÿ In the book of Hebrews 3:13, But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. What he is saying is that we need to share with each other our weaknesses, our failures, our problems, so that we can build each other up!ÿ He's saying that if we don't air out those things and allow someone else to help us, we will be hardened.ÿ Somehow our attitude will grow cold and hard--a phenomenon I'm all too familiar with. How often?ÿ Daily!ÿ This is a lot of honesty.ÿ In fact, I would say it is more honesty than just about 95% of us get into here, including me. Of course, that does explain a lot of the distance between us in our relationships. Let me just give you a few comments on the practical stuff of honesty. <h2>Know where your acceptance comes from</h2> The first things that is imperative if we are going to be really honest with other people, is to know that it is not other people's acceptance that matters.ÿ We don't go to other humans for acceptance.ÿ We may, but a) we will get burned, and b) we will always struggle with honesty. Because our acceptance and forgiveness has to start with God.ÿ God is the one whom we have to first and foremost go to for acceptance and forgiveness.ÿ And we have to be able to stand on the foundation that he does accept us and forgive us.ÿ That's why we can go to others and be honest. ""Because God accepts me and loves me, I can go to others and be honest."" We talked about a passage last week that I'll refer you to again, II Cor. 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! This is how God views us if we have come to him for his forgiveness.ÿ This is how he views us if we come to him for a relationship.ÿ This is what it is to be a Christian, to come to God and request his forgiveness.ÿ And it tells us here that from that point on, God looks at us as a new creature. And it's because of this that we can go to other humans.ÿ We go to other humans, not for acceptance and our source of identity.ÿ We go to them because they can help us.ÿ We go to them because closeness demands honesty. <h2>Lots of time</h2> The second point has to do with the type of time you spend with a person.ÿ You may think this is a little simple, but it's true: the kind of time you spend with someone will greatly help the honesty of the relationship. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you are having lunch with someone, you don't finish the hamburger and say, ""So, let me tell you the way I really amÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ It's just too awkward. You have to have time together.ÿ I mean lots of time.ÿ You have to intentionally schedule hours of time on end.ÿ But of course, the issue isnot just time.ÿ It has to be time which is focused on communication.ÿ What I mean is not TV, playing a game, etc.ÿ It has to be an intimate setting with good opportunity for communication. If you are with someone for long periods of intimate time, alone or maybe with three at the most, it is hard to not start coming out with the real stuff. I think this should be done regularly.ÿ But it is also something that we can go out of our way for.ÿ I have gone on trips with people, just a person or two for the weekend--to try and achieve this.ÿ And I try to make it so that we are spending time talking, lots of time. <h1>Submission to God</h1> The third and final point about real human contact I want to make here is that both parties need to be in submission to God.ÿ I'm saying that we need to consciously submit our relationship to God. I said last week that one of the greatest problems we have in the church is people who look at everything horizontally.ÿ That means that they see everything as a matter of relating to other humans.ÿ They fail to see God's hand, God's presence. Well, if you approach another human from that perspective, eventually (I don't know when) that relationship will either break apart or grow cold and distant. <h2>Provides long term meaning</h2> For one, seeing your relationship in the context of submitting to God provides the long term meaning for that relationship.ÿ It's not just me and you.ÿ It's that God is using me in your life and you in mine. We don't have time to go over it tonight, but read the chapter of IÿCor.ÿ12:13-27.ÿ There Paul makes the case that we should appreciate how God uses other people in our lives, and us in other's.ÿ That is one of the ways that a relationship keeps it's steam up over the long haul.ÿ You try to see how God can use you in each other's lives. <h2>Helps us accept each other</h2> Secondly, both parties submitting to God helps us to accept each other.ÿ I wanted to talk at length about accepting each other, but I can only say a few words.ÿ And one of those words is that at the heart of accepting the people in your life, is this issue: To see them as tools God is using in your life.ÿ To be effected by them is to be effected by God.ÿ To be changed by them is to be changed by God. The author of Hebrews tells us that hardships in our lives are from God.ÿ Ulitmately, they are from him.ÿ In Hebrewsÿ12, he puts it this way, And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: ""My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,ÿ because the Lord disciplines those he lovesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? What he is saying is that there are hardships that come our way, usually in the form of people and relationships, right?ÿ But don't make the mistake of forgetting where they ultimately come from.ÿ Ultimately, God is in charge.ÿ Nothing happens in your relationships or in your life without God knowing about it. And that is why the author of Hebrews can say that we must recognize God's discipline and not just see things horizontally. People do things all the time to ruffle my world.ÿ And I know that a lot of people would conclude, ""This person is getting to be a pain.""ÿ But a passage like this tells us we need to say, ""God, how are you using this person in my life?"" There's no way a relationship can survive if you don't have this view.ÿ You'll just butt heads.ÿ It's just the two of you.ÿ And sooner or later, you'll either break apart or find ways to make some distance between yourselves. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know plenty of families who know exactly what issues you can never talk about.ÿ You just can't talk about them. And for some relationships, those issues are so many, that they can hardly talk about anything substantive. The only way around this is to both turn to God and submit to him as the higher authority. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: My wife and I were battling just this week about something.ÿ And it had to come to this point because we're both so stubborn.ÿ We said, ""OK, I hate what I'm hearing from you.""ÿ ""And I hate what I'm hearing from you.""ÿ ""So, let's at least turn our hearts to God in prayer here and acknowledge that we want to hear from him.""ÿ And when we did that, the whole attitude changed. I just can't see a relationship lasting, and still maintaining depth, if both parties aren't agreed to submit to the authority of God as he works through that other person.ÿ We both have to realize, ""My struggle isn't with you.ÿ Actually, my struggle is with God, and how he is using you in my life to change me.""",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t03934.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Human Diversity - Buck McCallum",

"Work: Key to Usefulness",1991-08-04,," <h1>Issues to address</h1> What about the joy of work? What is the purpose of work? The pursuit of excellence. When work goes too far. What about the supposed ""work ethic""? <h1>Inro: What is work?</h1> I want to talk about work.ÿ I've been telling people that this week.ÿ And everyone always goes, ""Work?ÿ Work what?ÿ What do you mean by work?""ÿ Then I say it again.ÿ ""Work.""ÿ And they go, ""You mean, `work'?"" Why is this?ÿ Why do people have a hard time with me getting up here and talking about work?ÿ When you think about it, work encompasses probably half of our lives.ÿ Because for one, work is something you have to do to make money.ÿ For some of us, it is something we do 8 hours or more every weekday.ÿ But work is also something you have to do to get things done, like school-work or home-work or work around the house.ÿ Even the things that we do around here, by way of serving one another or teaching the Bible we call ""Christian work"" or ""working for God."" I know that when I use that word, ""work,"" different images and feelings come to our minds.ÿ If you hate your job, then the notion of work is a dreadful one.ÿ You were hoping that you could have one last night of forgetting about it before the weekend was over. Some people have come to enjoy it.ÿ They may not enjoy the sweat and toil of it all, but they definitely enjoy the fruit of their labors.ÿ Some of you may even be sitting here thinking about what you could accomplish this week at work. I want to think about what work is.ÿ And I want to think about when people get into work to much. <h2>Work has always been in the plan</h2> The first time we meet work in the Bible is right when God created the first humans.ÿ The Bible tells us that God placed people here on the earth, ""to cultivate it and to keep it"" (Gen.ÿ2:15). There's work.ÿ What's interesting is, if you know about the creation of human beings, according to the Bible, you know that God placed them in a perfect environment.ÿ And yet, that didn't mean it couldn't be improved upon.ÿ That didn't mean that there weren't things to do.ÿ When we say it was a perfect environment, we should think of that in terms of the absence of various evils.ÿ So, there weren't some of the hardships and fears that are so commonplace now. But there was plenty of opportunity to grow and improve upon what God had made.ÿ And that is the commission that Adam was given, ""Grow this.ÿ Improve upon it.ÿ Make it better."" And that kind of captures the essence of what work was meant to be.ÿ It was meant to be productive.ÿ It was meant to take things that were already good and make them better. <h2>Meant to make us useful</h2> But there is another important aspect of God's design for work, which people often forget or don't even know about.ÿ We have no problem understanding that work is meant to make good things.ÿ That's what motivates us to do it.ÿ Whether it's moneyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But there's another part to the plan for work which is equally important, maybe more.ÿ And that is, work is designed to make us useful to others.ÿ This is the key to your usefulness. <h3>Phil. 1:22-24</h3> If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! ÿI am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;ÿ but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. Paul, in Philippians, is contemplating the fact that he might be killed soon.ÿ And in his thinking he knows that if he stays on, there is a lot of work for him to do.ÿ And look why he decides it would be best to stay on and continue to work: it would be best for them.ÿ He knows that his work is what benefits others. <h3>Eph. 4:28</h3> He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need. You see two things here.ÿ First, Paul defines work as doing something useful with your hands.ÿ What does it mean when it says that it is useful?ÿ It means that others benefit from it.ÿ You aren't a piece of fat on society.ÿ You are useful to others. But, beyond that, it reaps the reward of being able to give--further usefulness. <h3>Summary</h3> So, work is the key to our usefulness.ÿ This is something that people who hate work often fail to realize.ÿ They're focusing only on what they get out of it right now. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What this job gives me?ÿ A bad back and a small paycheck! And it goes beyond the job.ÿ It applies to work in all areas of life.ÿ When people hate work, it is usually because they are not looking at it from this perspective. I don't know if you realize it or not, but the verse that we sometimes toss around as Christians (from the words of Jesus himself), ""It is better to give than to receive,"" comes as a description of work.ÿ To get the full context on thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, Paul and Jesus are saying that there is reward in work.ÿ And that reward comes from focusing on how my work can benefit others, rather than just looking at how it benefits me.ÿ This is an area of perspective that will either bring joy or drudgery to your work. At the same time, this understanding gives us insight into the state of mind of many who don't work.ÿ Or those who work very little.ÿ It is sad and defeating because you feel useless.ÿ They have to struggle with feelings of uselesness.ÿ And those feelings are for real, since work is the key to making them useful. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some of you may not know this, but this is one of the main reasons I quit smoking.ÿ It was because I can't stand to sit around.ÿ When I get sick, I am the most nasty, grumpy, hard person to get along with because I hate to be useless.ÿ If I'm sick for even 2 days, to the point that I can't do anything, I get hard to handle.ÿ And then I started thinking, ""Cancer patients sometimes have to lay around for 6 months!ÿ Or a year! <h1>When we get too absorbed in work</h1> It is precisely this issue, the issue of usefulness, that causes people to become too absorbed in work.ÿ We all know that it is a common scenario for someone to become so caught up on work or school that they have very little else in their lives. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know that when I was in school, I had to work sometimes 12 hours a day studying.ÿ Then I also held a part time job on top of that.ÿ The net result that almost all of my energy was taken up by work of one kind or another.ÿ You can ask my wife about that. <h2>Emphasizing only usefulness</h2> What is happening when someone gets caught up like this?ÿ Why do people get so absorbed with work that they have relatively little else of substance in their lives?ÿ The reason is that they are focusing on usefulness as the source of their identity, to the exclusion of all other sources. And there are other sources of identity that are very, very important. <h2>We have inherent value: God loves us</h2> For one, there is our inherent value as a person, which is seen by the fact that God loves us no matter what.ÿ It's not like people-love.ÿ If you become uselessÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But God's love is different.ÿ His love says, ""I love you and I want to have a relationship with you no matter what you do."" You think about it.ÿ Why does God love us?ÿ Why does God love you?ÿ And the answer is that he loves you just because you are you.ÿ That's all.ÿ This is so hard for us to believe.ÿ Because we have been conditioned to believe that our value lies in how useful we are. But to look at it from God's perspective, it's a different picture.ÿ From his perspective, it's not like humans are running around this earth doing great things that are useful to him.ÿ God's not up there saying, ""Man, I really need these guys!""ÿ What can you do for the God who created the universe that he needs?ÿ What can you do to make yourself useful to him? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Paul, the apostle, spent much of his life trying to prove that he could be useful to God.ÿ He was intensely religious and worked for God like none of his peers.ÿ But in the end, he says in Phil.ÿ3, ""It amounted to a nice little pile of manure.""ÿ That's what it was worth. God doesn't need us.ÿ And the things we run around and do don't make us useful to God. But it's even more than that.ÿ From God's perspective we are actually alienated from him.ÿ We are at odds with him.ÿ People aren't automatically on good terms with God.ÿ So, it's not just that we can't do things to be useful to him.ÿ It's also that the things we do make us more distant from him.ÿ Our deeds are morally offensive to him. And yet, in spite of all this, the Bible tells us that God loves us.ÿ He loves people he doesn't need.ÿ He loves people who aren't useful to him.ÿ He loves people who are actually at odds with him.ÿ The Bible puts it this way in Rom.ÿ5: God demonstrates His own love toward us in this: While we were still at odds, Christ died for us.ÿ Now, since we have been forgiven by His blood, we shall be saved from the judgment of God through Christ's sacrifice.ÿ For while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son. That is the extent of God's love.ÿ God loves us so much and wants a relationship with us so much, that he was willing to come and die for us so that we would no longer be alienated from him. That's a lot of value.ÿ God is saying that you are worth giving his life for.ÿ It doesn't matter what you do or don't do.ÿ ""I love you so much I would die for you."" ""But God, what have I done for you?"" ""Nothing."" ""But God, I'm not a very good person!"" ""That's right.ÿ That's not why I love you."" So, we have value just because we are who we are.ÿ And that is seen by how much God loves us and how much he wants to have a relationship with us. <h2>We have relational value</h2> But there is another type of value we have, once again independant of the usefulness we gain from work.ÿ And that is the value we have from relating to people.ÿ This is relational value.ÿ I matter to others and they matter to me because we relate. We share.ÿ We talk.ÿ We express emotions.ÿ We support each other.ÿ These are all things that are part of relationships.ÿ It's not part of work, although some folks might treat it that way.ÿ This is a different realm.ÿ It's the relational realm. And we matter to each other because we can have meaningful relationships. Here again is something we'll find is lacking in a person's life when they become obsessive about work.ÿ When they get all caught up in work, it is to the exclusion of other things.ÿ They are taking their identity from usefulness, and completely neglecting who they are as a person (their inate value), and how they can relate to others.ÿ And this is evidenced by their lack of a relationship with God and relationships with others. <h2>Abilities atrophy</h2> Here's something that we should be concerned about.ÿ I know that the scenario I am talking about is so widely accepted, it's almost glorified.ÿ But the sad fact is that when you neglect these other sources of meaning and fulfillment, they don't just stay there and wait for you to pick them up again. Your ability to relate to others, for example, isn't like a tool that you can place carefully in its rack and come back and it's still there waiting to be used.ÿ It isn't like riding a bike, ""Once you learn, you never forget."" It's more like staying in shape.ÿ If you get lazy, and eat all kinds of food, and never get active, then maybe by the time you get around to fixing the problem you've got a big predicament on your hands.ÿ Your relational ability atrophies over time.ÿ When you exclude it from your life, it gets worse. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember after that time of school, I finally finished.ÿ And I thought, ""OK, now it's time to get back into people!""ÿ I was excited at the prospect.ÿ But the problem is, I had forgotten how!ÿ I remember before I had kind of chuckled at people who were socially retarded.ÿ They never knew what to say, couldn't interact with people.ÿ But now I was one.ÿ I had the hardest time just walking up to someone and introducing myself. I'm still pretty retarded I find.ÿ The worst part of it is that we get into our work, or our achievements we have this ability to virtually block out our hollowness in these other areas.ÿ ""I don't see it, I'm too busy with other things."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was just on vacation a couple weeks ago with some of you.ÿ And at the end of vacation a couple people came up to me to talk to me about some things that they had noticed.ÿ Separately, ""Buck, I noticed you were kind of distant.ÿ You seemed a little depressed.""ÿ ""Naw!ÿ I had a great vacation!""ÿ Then the other guy, ""Buck, I noticed you were a little distant from people.ÿ Were you kind of depressed?""ÿ ""Not at all!ÿ I've been having a great time!""ÿ In my mind I was thinking, ""I read a Great Tom Clancy book.ÿ I got to work some on my computer.ÿ I caught some fishÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ But I stepped back and thought, ""What are these guys seeing that I'm missing?""ÿ And I started to remember, ""Oh yeah!ÿ People!ÿ That is a novel thought!""ÿ And I started to realize that I was very distant from people, maybe even a little bit lonely and depressed!ÿ Fortunately, nothing that a good week at work couldn't solve. So these are not abilities that you can just pick up and use at a moment's notice, even though you've been neglecting them. <h2>Hard to appreciate relationship with God</h2> And the worst side of this is that it's hard, once you've focused your attention on your achievments and work as your identity, to believe that God loves you just as you are.ÿ That grows harder and harder the more identity you stake in your usefulness, your achievements and so on. Think of it.ÿ If you got to the point, as many do, where you were taking your identity from the work and achievments that you have, then to turn to God you would have to say, ""I guess none of that counts here.""ÿ Because it doesn't.ÿ None of that counts with him.ÿ And to get to the point where you say that none of your achievments, none of your work matters before God, that would really hurt the pride. And that is why it is that the more people take from their work, the harder it is to come to God.ÿ It's a complete shift of gears. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You could imagine someone who for their whole lifetime took their identity from one thing, like their physical abilities.ÿ Maybe he's a great athelete.ÿ And then, he finds himself in a setting where that doesn't matter anymore, not one bit.ÿ To say the least, you would feel a little insecure. But that's where most folks are with God.ÿ God is saying to us, ""I want to accept you, forgive you and have a relationship with you just because I love you.""ÿ And that is very hard for people to take.ÿ This is what is standing in the way of them becoming Christians. Even after someone becomes a Christian, this is a constant barrier in our relationship with God.ÿ Because we continue to try to relate to God on the basis of our work.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04187.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Work - Buck McCallum",

"Emotions - Anger and Fear",1991-10-20,," <h1>Intro</h1> I'm glad Jeff talked about the issue of repressing emotions last week and some of the damage it can cause.ÿ Emotions are so powerful.ÿ But at the same time, they are so beastial.ÿ Some of the same emotions we experience, excitement, anger, etc., are shared with a host of animals. What's unique about us as humans is the way we interpret emotions, how we can bring them to mind with thoughts, and control them and channel them with our thoughts. <h1>What is anger?</h1> <h2>A biological reaction</h2> People are very confused about this emotion.ÿ This emotion, as it appears all our emotions, originates in the center of our brain, just above the brain stem.ÿ It is an emotion of readiness, action, alertness.ÿ When you get angry, you are like a coiled springÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Anger is not aggression.ÿ That may be how you choose to act on your anger.ÿ But they are not equal.ÿ This is very important for our discussion, as you will see later.ÿ Aggression, like all responses to anger, is a learned response.ÿ But anger itself is arousal to action, and it may be very powerful. It is impossible as a human to avoid anger.ÿ It is absolutely a basic biological response. The Bible recognizes this, as it assumes we'll get angry.ÿ We'll look at some passages on anger in a moment. But the Bible's concern is with how we react to that anger. <h2>We learn our response</h2> What is unique about us as humans is that in our brains we have a frontal lobe which takes emotional input, like anger, and interprets it and decides what action to take.ÿ So, the second, very important part of our definition of anger: How you respond to anger is a completely learned behavior.ÿ You learn it by trying it, and getting reinforced. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Kids who try to throw temper tantrums, and then get their way, learn that this is an effective way to deal with that agitated feeling, that coiled spring.ÿ He lodges that in his brain for later. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Someone who pouts and withdraws, and then gets his way, learns that is effectiveÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So that part is learned.ÿ The anger itself is biological, but it is also just a matter of being wound up, coiled, ready to act. <h1>Why do we get angry?</h1> <h2>A response to threat</h2> The basic reason we get angry is because we are threatened.ÿ It arouses this alertness.ÿ That is why anger and fear are so closely related.ÿ Fear, emergency, challenge, all of these can give rise to anger. But anger is the emotion that we want to focus on. <h2>We get angry at people we need</h2> We get angry because we are threatened.ÿ That threat can come in any number of ways.ÿ It doesn't have to be some kind of a danger.ÿ It can when you want something, and the threat is that you won't get it.ÿ You feel like you need it, but you can't get it.ÿ Then you get angry. This is why it is that we get angry at people we feel that we need the most.ÿ If you feel like you need someone for something, and then they threaten you by not delivering on what you think you need, then it arouses anger. You think about the people you get angry at the mostÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Then think about the people you never get angry at.ÿÿ It is probably because you don't feel like you need that person.ÿ They don't pose a threat. This is going to be a very important concept when we think about God's solutions for anger. <h1>How anger manifests itself</h1> The third question I want to ask about anger is how it manifests itself.ÿ Because I think there may be some people here who believe that they have only an occassional problem with anger.ÿ Others may actually believe that they have no problem with anger at all.ÿ Let me tell you, there is no one here tonight, who has a brain in their heads, who doesn't get angry. I have borrowed four categories of anger mis-management from a great book I have been reading on the subject, <em>Make Anger Your Ally</em>, by Neil Clark Warren. <h2>Exploders</h2> Exploders are the ones we all think of when we think of an angry person.ÿ They are obviously the most visible.ÿ But you must realize that physiologically, the same chemicals and the same reactions are occuring in the body and brain of someone who represses their anger as someone who explodes. They're both angry.ÿ It just depends what they are doing with it. <h2>Somatasizers</h2> There are those who have learned to ignore their anger, or at least pretend to.ÿ They have been negatively reinforced for expression of anger in other ways. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Maybe when they exploded, they were severly punished, or they didn't get their way. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know one common theme is for women to be taught that displays of anger are ""unladylike"" and brutish.ÿ They're taught that they won't be liked if they display their anger. So, a very common scenario for both men and women is to repress that anger by not coming to terms with it.ÿ But the problem is that they have not resolved the source of the anger.ÿ So they keep re-living the angering event.ÿ They keep remember the hurt or the pain. And here's the killer: Each time they re-live that event, the same biological response occurs.ÿ They feel the tension.ÿ The adrenaline increases.ÿ There's a tightening.ÿ And the whole thing is done all over again! So the result is their body is constantly being tightened and re-tightened, like a spring.ÿ There's damage.ÿ Dr. Warren documents the many types of damage tha can occur. But beyond incidental damage that might occur from this cycle of tension, there are those who have actually learned to make themselves sick.ÿ It's been demonstrated that people know how to give themselves headaches, vomitting, dizziness, etc.ÿ But it is also likely, but harder to demonstrate in a lab, that people can give themselves other diseases. Why would someone make themselves sick?ÿ Even if it were possible?ÿ Well, I'm not saying that they say, ""OK, here's a headache.""ÿ It's much more subtle than, just like for all of these forms of anger mismanagement.ÿ What has happened to this person is that he or she has been reinforced for being ill. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Their parents might punish them for outbursts, ignore them at other times. But when they took ill, then they got attention. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I suppose another scenario might be living in a high pressure home or environment.ÿ And when you get sick is the only relief. What you learn through these kinds of reinforcements is that the state of sickness is a good thing.ÿ It's comfortable.ÿ It feels good, even though the body feels bad. So some people, consciously or otherwise, drive their anger down into their bodies. <h2>Self-punishers</h2> Then there are self-punishers.ÿ Basically, a self-punisher takes his anger--his aroused state, a state of power--and turns it on himself.ÿ If something happens to go wrong, even between himself and another person, he blames himself.ÿ He feels like he is loser.ÿ He may call himself a lot of different names. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have watched this type of anger verbalized before, and it has been very dismaying.ÿ I remember talking to a girl who had just gotten out of a very cruel and ugly relationship.ÿ And her reaction was, ""I keep doing this!ÿ I'm such a loser!ÿ I can't stop ruining relationships!"" I couldn't believe my ears!ÿ I'm going to bet that was just the tip of the iceberg.ÿ The things that a self-punisher would say out loud would have to be much more mild than the things they think. Of course the result is going to be a severly depressed and despairing state of mind.ÿ And when I say depressed and despairing, what I mean is an unmotivated state where you feel like you can't do anythingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Warren relates a study done on dogs, where they were in two halves of a box with a mettle mesh for a floor.ÿ A slight electrical charge could be applied to the mesh on one side, and the dog would jump over to the other.ÿ Well, then they tied the dogs so that they couldn't jump over.ÿ And, after a while, they stopped trying.ÿ But what is amazing is that even after they untied them, they still wouldn't try!ÿ They would just brace themselves for the pain.ÿ Even when researchers would try to help them over, the dogs would resist them! There are plenty of people like that.ÿ From a lifetime of tearing into themselves with negative, angry messages, they are despairing. <h2>Underhanders</h2> Finally, there are underhanders.ÿ These guys are slippery.ÿ These guys are very tricky.ÿ Because what they have learned is that outright expression of anger is not to their advantage.ÿ So, they have learned to let it out at people in a way that their victim may not even know it.ÿ Usually, the tools of choice are sarcasm, jabs and cuts.ÿ But they can resort to pouting, acting dismal, very distant, or whatever it is that they know irritates the target of their anger. This is another form of anger mismanagement that I can understand very well.ÿ You see, I learned at a very young age, that exploding with my anger had its price. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was the kind of kid who threw temper tantrums.ÿ And they were special.ÿ I shudder to think of how extreme I could get with them.ÿ We're talking bashing things, rolling around, throwing my body down all over the place, drooling, screaming uncontrollably.ÿ You would have thought I was demon possessed.ÿ But the worst part of it all was that I had 3 older brothers.ÿ And they used to say, for entertainment, ""Hey, let's go get Buck angry!""ÿ And when they would succeed, then they would start to dance around me with glee and sing a song, ""Temper tantrum timeÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" I learned that when you explode with your emotions, you are the victim.ÿ You are exposed for anyone to take advantage of you.ÿ So I worked and worked and worked to get control.ÿ I asked advice of people.ÿ Here was a little kid, talking to people like they were doctors, ""How do you get control of your anger when you feel it coming on?""ÿ So I learned how to do that, externally. Instead, I began to do what all underhanders do.ÿ I learned to target people with my anger in underhanded ways.ÿ I learned to watch someone and understand what gets them angry. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: ""Oh, you hate when I'm real noisy."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: ""Oh, you hate it when someone doesn't respond to you, when they just look at you."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: ""Oh, you hate it when someone acts like you're stupid."" I began to master the science of knowing what irritates people and getting them. The worst thing about the underhander is that they can finally get to you, and you say, ""Man!ÿ Cut it out!ÿ You're driving me crazy!""ÿ And they can say, ""Oh?ÿ Cool it man!ÿ I don't know what you're talking about!ÿ Just settle down and explain your problem to me.""ÿ And they make you feel stupid for getting angry! Very effective, and very alienating.ÿ It's the kind of person that no one wants to get close to because they're dangerous.ÿ You can sense it. No underhander I've talked to likes that part of the deal. <h1>Anger is not bad</h1> We've talked about anger, where it comes from and how we see it differently in our lives.ÿ But we all see it.ÿ Now I want to talk about God's point of view on how to handle it. And the first thing we need to realize is that anger is not bad.ÿ Even though many of the passages in the Bible are negative about anger, this is because humans mishandle their anger.ÿ That is why the Bible says that anger is dangerous and harmful.ÿ No humans handle it right. On the other hand, if anger is handled correctly, the Bible recognizes it as a positive force. <h2>God gets angry</h2> For one thing, God himself gets angry. <h3>Jesus in the temple</h3> There are numerous examples of this throughout the Bible.ÿ But one of the most startling is when Jesus was on the earth, and he got angry at some people in the temple. The people who ran the temple at the time were doing what religious people are famous for, bilking gullible worshippers.ÿ They had quite a little elaborate scheme set up there.ÿ And when Jesus saw it, he was furious.ÿ He had to do something about it.ÿ He couldn't just sit idle.ÿ This is what anger is all about--the power to act. He didn't just act on impulse.ÿ But he went back out of the temple, the Bible tells us, and fashioned a cord whip.ÿ Then he marched back in there and whooped on all the salesmen and con artists so hard that they left their money and ran! That's some serious forcefulness.ÿ That's some serious power.ÿ And it was used rightly. So, God gets angry.ÿ Jesus got angry as a human.ÿ It is possible to use anger in a good way. <h2>It is assumed (Eph.ÿ4:26)</h2> In another passage, Eph.ÿ4:26, the Bible tells us that the problem is not anger itself.ÿ It saysÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, it is possible to be angry, but not to sin.ÿ That is an idea we need to develop here. <h2>Conclusion</h2> So, basically, it seems like the Bible is saying that you should be angry, but you should handle it like God does. That is what I want to turn to now. <h1>Scriptures on handling anger</h1> <h2>The source of stability: acceptance from God</h2> Where we need to start in dealing with anger is to find some stability.ÿ We need to address the problem feeling so threatened by people and situations.ÿ How can we reduce the threat we feel?ÿ That could help us to substantially control our anger. Secondly, when we do feel threatened, we need to somehow make it so that it's not a panick situation.ÿ In other words, how can we keep a threat in perspective and see it for what it is?ÿ It's when we blow things up that our anger can really take off and we can take irrational measures. The Bible has a couple solutions for this that are absolutely unique.ÿ Because they are solutions that God offers. <h3>Our acceptance is from God</h3> The first is that we need the emotional stabilizing of God's love.ÿ This is going to be a theme that we come back to several times in this series.ÿ But basically, it is the idea that your emotions will be more stable, more secure, and you will feel less threatened if you feel unconditional acceptance and love. This is a principle that we now see secular counselors advocating as a basci human need.ÿ People like Carl Rogers say we all need ""positive regard"" and ""unconditional acceptance.""ÿ But it's very difficult for them to say where such love would or could come from. But God has always said that we need his love.ÿ We need to understand and believe in his love in order to be complete.ÿ I like the strong way that Paul puts it in Titusÿ3.ÿ Paul is a blunt, straightforward type of guy.ÿ And if he has a problem, he calls it.ÿ Here's how he described himself apart from God's love, At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.ÿ But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,ÿ he saved us. Talk about emotions out of controlÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And he says that his only salvation was experiencing the kindness and love of God. This is something that we need to experience.ÿ God says we need it.ÿ We were meant to have it as humans.ÿ But the barrier that has always stood in the way has been our sins.ÿ All our sins stood as a point of contention between ourselves and God. And yet, in his first act of unconditional love for us, he offers to completely forgive us.ÿ This can be your first experience of God's unconditional love, to come to him and seek his forgiveness. <h3>Our needs are met by God</h3> But God wants to do more.ÿ He wants to make it so that you don't have to rely on yourself and other people for your needs.ÿ Here, like I said before, is where the major source of threat and therefore anger comes from.ÿ But God wants to undermine that by promising to meet our needs himself. In Philippiansÿ4, Paul again says this about God, And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. That is God's desire.ÿ If we trust him, he wants to meet our needs.ÿ And we're not talking some pie in the sky, theoretical promise here.ÿ He really wants to meet them. I wish we had time to turn to Matt.ÿ6, where Jesus identifies the source of worries and anxieties as us, trying to take care of ourselves.ÿ And he says that the answer isÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Gen. 4</h2> <h3>Why are you angry?</h3> These two insights about God and his love for us are everything.ÿ I could sit up here and give you a 10 point manual on how to handle your anger, and it wouldn't matter.ÿ Because this is where it all starts.ÿ However, I do want to give at least a few practical points from the Bible as well. The first comes from God's dealings with a guy named Cain, back in Gen. 4ÿ The situation is that Cain's younger brother had done some things to show him up.ÿ And Cain was jealous and angry about that.ÿ It's interesting how God intervenes in the situation. Notice God didn't say, ""Cut that out!""ÿ He asked a question.ÿ And it was a good question. ""Why are you angry?"" This is the first thing we need to start to do if we are going to get control of our anger: Understand what is making us angry.ÿ Put it into words. Now, what this means first and foremost is that we have to take responsibility for our anger.ÿ It's not enough to say, ""He made me angry by shortchanging me.""ÿ You have to go deeper than that: What expectation did you have for that person?ÿ What did you think that you needed from that person? So, instead it might be, ""I felt I needed such and such from him, and I didn't get it.ÿ So I got angry.""ÿ You're making the link to your felt needs and expectations. We would understand our anger so much better if we took on this practice.ÿ And I suggest we do so with another person.ÿ This is somewhat embarassing.ÿ But if you got into the habbit of explaining to someone why you got angry.ÿ It sounds remarkable as it comes out. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I got angry with her because she brought bad feelings to me on a night when I wanted to have good feelings.ÿ I felt I needed good feelings, she injected bad ones. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I felt I needed to get my way, so I thought I could bowl her over with anger! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I thought if I gave in it would be embarassing.ÿ I felt I needed to protect my pride, so I lashed out! So the first practical step I can recommend is to begin to understand why you get angry.ÿ You may need some help here.ÿ The help of an uninvolved party you can be honest with.ÿ Begin to verbalize the reasons you get angry.ÿ Some even suggest that you keep an anger journal. <h3>Do right</h3> The second thing we see about this passage is that God tells him something about his feelings.ÿ ""Do right,"" he said, ""and your feelings will change."" This is a revelation into how we are as humans from the architect himself. It's not clear exactly what God wanted Cain to do here.ÿ Although, it probably was clear to Cain.ÿ Cain's conscience was probably telling him what to do. <h2>Resolving with people</h2> In other places in the Bible, however, we know that God puts a high priority on resolving between people. I wish I had time to go into the whole issue of resolution between angry parties.ÿ But at the bottom of it all, I can say that the insight the Bible has, which you won't hear elsewhere, is that God doesn't think that pride is something you should try to keep. That's what you'll keep hearing from everyone.ÿ It's universal.ÿ ""I had to hold on to my pride!""ÿ ""No matter how much I liked the feller, I couldn't just throw away my pride and act like nothing was wrong!"" The Bible sees pride as nothing but a trouble maker.ÿ It is the wall that comes between people and turns simple anger into hatred and division. The Bible puts a high value on humility.ÿ Because I know I'm loved by God, because I know I have value, I don't have to cling to this self-centered concept we call pride. If you have a Bible, I want to give you some scriptures to look up later and consider what they have to say about pride, getting along with each other and resolving. Matthew 5:23, 24; Romansÿ12:17-21; Philippiansÿ2:3, 4 <h1>Other thoughts to add</h1> What about ""getting it off your chest?",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04213.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Emotions - Buck McCallum",
"Emotions - Anger - Practical Steps",1991-10-27,,"  <h1>Intro</h1> Last week we talked about anger.ÿ And because there was so much information, we flowed over into this week.ÿ I said that this week I wanted to get into some practicals for handling your anger.ÿ But before I do that, I just want to remind you of what we did last week: We defined anger.ÿ We said that anger is just a physiological response of readiness.ÿ A readiness to act.ÿ It is not equal with aggression.ÿ This is so hard for us to understand.ÿ I know from many of the questions I got last week, that is is hard for us to put away this misconception.ÿ But anger is not equal to aggression.ÿ Aggression is just one way that people handle anger. There is at least one important implication of this: Everyone gets angry.ÿ That is something you cannot help, if you are human. Briefly, here are the four ways that we identified anger in people.ÿ These are four ways that people mishandle their angerÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We also said that anger comes when we are threatened by something.ÿ We may be threatened by someone harming us.ÿ Or, I may be threatened when I feel like I need something from someone, and then I don't get it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: One thing that really bothers me is if I feel like I won't get my <strong>way</strong>.ÿ If I don't get my way, it says something about me.ÿ Maybe it says that I'm weak.ÿ Or maybe it says that my ways was stupid.ÿ Which means that I'm stupid.ÿ I know I'm not stupid, so I'm going to get my way! We don't go through all these reasonings.ÿ But we have at different times.ÿ And if we could think it through, then we would start to see that somehow, some way, we were feeling threatened and therefore we got angry. The note we ended on last week was that first and foremost, we need a foundation for our emotions.ÿ We need some security for our emotions.ÿ We need something to give us some stability so that each and every little thing won't set us off.ÿ If I feel real insecure, about myself or about the situation, then I'll be more likely to get angry.ÿ I'll be more likely to get threatened. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Have you ever wondered why a full grown man can get angry, and react to it violently to the point that he starts to beat on his wife or his children?ÿ Is he thrilled to be able to beat on someone?ÿ What is it?ÿ What it is, is that man is incredible insecure, to the point that he thinks that wife or those children pose a threat.ÿ They threaten him.ÿ They may threaten his sense of control.ÿ They may threaten him by making him feel unimportant.ÿ I don't know how.ÿ But this man is so insecure, he gets threatened by his own wife and children. That's why it is that the people who can't control their anger are very fragile people. So it's that insecurity and that instability we began to address last week.ÿ And we said that first and foremost, people need to encounter the unconditional love of God.ÿ Experiencing God's unconditional love is where it all starts.ÿ Because knowing and experiencing God's love is where you ought to get your emotional security from. I can tell how my relationship with God is doing, in part by how often I get angry.ÿ Sometimes you will find that you are getting angry a lot.ÿ And I know that symptom as one that tells me I am not doing well in my relationship with God.ÿ When I haven't been talking to him or relating to him very much, then it starts to show. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I get angry at my dog, because she won't submit to my control! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I get angry at my tools because they won't do what I want. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I get angry at other drivers, because they won't get out of my way. I can get more unstable because my relationship with God is less stable. So, before any of the things I am going to talk about tonight, this is most importantÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>God's advice to the first angry person: Gen.ÿ4</h1> As we talk about how to handle anger, I want to look at a couple of passages out of the Bible where God gives us insight into this emotion.ÿ The first is the first instance recorded in the Bible where someone gets angry. It happens with a young man named Cain, back in Gen. 4ÿ Cain was Adam and Eve's first son.ÿ The situation is that Cain's younger brother had done some things to show him up.ÿ And Cain was jealous and angry about that.ÿ But what's really interesting is how God intervenes in the situation. <h2>Why are you angry?</h2> Notice God didn't say, ""Cut that out!""ÿ He asked a question.ÿ And it was a good question. ""Why are you angry?"" This is the first thing we need to start to do if we are going to get control of our anger: Understand what is making us angry.ÿ Put it into words. Now, what this means first and foremost is that we have to take responsibility for our anger.ÿ God knew what happened.ÿ But he wanted to know why that made Cain angry.ÿ Or, he wanted Cain to think about that. It's not enough to say, ""He made me angry by ripping me off.""ÿ You have to go deeper than that: What expectation did <strong>you</strong> have for that person?ÿ What did you think that you needed from that person? Remember, if I don't expect anything from a person, then how are they going to make me angry?ÿ That's what I have to analyze and understand. So, instead of just saying, ""He did this to me,"" it might be, ""I felt I needed such and such from him, and I didn't get it.ÿ So I got angry.""ÿ You're making the link to your expectations. We would understand our anger so much better if we took on this practice.ÿ And I suggest we do so with another person.ÿ This is somewhat embarassing.ÿ But if you got into the habbit of explaining to someone why you got angry.ÿ It sounds remarkable as it comes out. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I thought if I gave in it would be embarassing.ÿ I felt I needed to protect my pride, so I lashed out! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I felt I needed to get my way, so I thought I could bowl her over with anger! As we start to say the reasons, it can be kind of surprising.ÿ You may find that some of the expectations you have on people are unrealistic.ÿ And there is something to deal with. So the first practical step I can recommend is to begin to understand why you get angry.ÿ You may need some help here.ÿ The help of an uninvolved party you can be honest with.ÿ Begin to verbalize the reasons you get angry.ÿ Some even suggest that you keep an anger journal. <h2>Do right</h2> The second thing we see about this passage is that God tells him something about his feelings.ÿ ""Do right,"" he said, ""and your feelings will change."" This is a revelation into how we are as humans from the architect himself.ÿ There is a relationship between our emotions and what we do.ÿ And, according to God, that relationship is exactly the opposite of what a lot of people believe.ÿ Most people believe that my feelings should dictate what I do.ÿ But God is saying here that your actions will direct your feelings. I just want to take a moment to address a popular teaching about anger at this point.ÿ It's known as ""venting.""ÿ There is an extremely popular brand of teaching, in professional counseling circles as well as popular advice, that if you are angry you have to ventilate the anger.ÿ It is unhealthy for you to hold it in, so you have to let it fly.ÿ And when they say this, it is almost always by some means of aggression. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Whether it's aggression at a dummy, or screaming, or whatever. The reasoning is that if you hold it in, you'll blow up at some point.ÿ Or, you may suffer from some of the diseases we talked about last week.ÿ So, instead of one big blow up, they say, you can have more little ones. Now, granted, it is bad to mishandle anger in the ways we talked about last week--self-punishing, underhanding, etc.ÿ But aggression is also mishandling of anger.ÿ And what research shows is that instead of lessening outbursts, aggression breeds aggression.ÿ The more you vent, the less self control you have against venting. This is why the Bible is so down on expression anger aggressively.ÿ I don't want to say that it is never good.ÿ But it is almost never the answer.ÿ As James says in Jamesÿ1:20, Man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. So, God wants us to deal with anger, but not necessarily by ventillating all over someone. It's not clear exactly what God wanted Cain to do here.ÿ Although, it probably was clear to Cain.ÿ Cain's conscience was probably telling him what to do. But that does bring us to our next topic, what it is that we should do with anger. <h1>What to do</h1> Anger is a motivator.ÿ Like I said, it makes you ready to act.ÿ It alerts you that you have to do something.ÿ In that respect, it can be a positive force. I have two different situations in which your anger could be a positive force. <h2>Situations: Agent of Change</h2> The first, is in situations.ÿ When you see things or settings that make you angry, then there is the possibility that you can be the one to bring change. First, you need to understand why you are angry, as we have already said.ÿ If, in confering with other people and prayer, you decide that you are angry for some very good reasons, then you may decide to use the force of your anger to bring some change. But never is it good to use the forcefulness of anger in an uncontrolled, undisciplined manner.ÿ Always under control. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Even in situations of seemingly unbriddled aggression, like the football feild, they will teach you that winners control their aggression.ÿ They get control of their emotions and use them carefully. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When Jesus got angry, I refered to it last week, he walked into the temple to chase out some religious con-artists.ÿ He was angry. ÿHe was angry because God's reputation was being defamed by these guys.ÿ But in his anger, he took the time to think of a plan.ÿ It tells us that he took the time to weave a whip of chords.ÿ And when it came down to it, that power of his anger was under his control. So, anger can be a great power for change, if it is under control. <h2>People: Resolve</h2> On the other hand, with people, I believe the emphasis in the Bible is that your anger should be a motivator not for change, like you're going to change that person, but for resolution.ÿ In other words, if you get angry at someone, and decide to do something about it, then usually that means we decide, ""I'm going to change him!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know that sometimes when I lash out at someone aggressively, what am I trying to do?ÿ I'm trying to make them pay so severely, that they will stop the offensive behavior.ÿ And that's the kind of thing that doesn't work (ref. Jamesÿ1).ÿ You may get short term compliance, but long term resentment and alienation. Instead, the Bible tells us that we should work at resolving.ÿ Paul puts it this way in Rom.ÿ12, If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. This isn't saying that you will never have conflict.ÿ It's saying that you take the initiative to make peace.ÿ Let the anger be a warning flag that we need to work something out with that person.ÿ Don't ignore it.ÿ But don't just lash out either. <h3>The barrier: pride</h3> Now the big barrier between people when they are angry is pride.ÿ Once you get angry at someone, there is this feeling that you have to protect your pride.ÿ That's one of those needs we think we have. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If someone hurts me, and I don't hurt them back, then what does that say about me? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I try to get my way, and someone can stop me, then what does that say about me? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I get in a fight with someone, and I don't win, then what does that say about me? You see how pride--the desire to protect your image--becomes entangled in our anger?ÿ And it's what makes it so hard to resolve. <h3>Pride destroys people</h3> But the Bible's perspective on pride is that it stinks.ÿ The Bible's view on pride is that it is a disease, and it wipes out it's owner. It's so funny.ÿ Because the way we think, the one who has the most pride is on top.ÿ Pride something to seek for and flaunt.ÿ But God says, in Pro.ÿ16:18, Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. And again in Pro.ÿ11:2, When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. Pride is something that is waiting to do you in.ÿ Pride makes people cling to things and try to prove things that are uterly ridiculous.ÿ Sometimes I've seen my pride at work when I'm trying to defend my actions or something, and I wonder if lost my sanity! And nowhere is this more the case than when we get angry.ÿ Then your pride will inflame and keep you from resolving. <h3>Discipline your pride</h3> The time to work on your pride is not in the heat of anger.ÿ By then it's too late.ÿ I don't want to say that there's no hope at that point.ÿ I'm just saying that the time to work on your pride is now, in everyday life.ÿ Your pride is something that has to be disciplined and brought under control. Pride won't just hurt you when you're angry.ÿ Pride is what makes people be unrealistic about themselves.ÿ Pride is what makes people fail to see their shortcomings.ÿ I could go on and on about the nightmare of human pride.ÿ But let's just say, it is not your friend. There are a lot of passages in the Bible on how to work on your pride.ÿ But one of the ones I like the best is in IÿPeterÿ5:5-7 Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, ""God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."" Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time, casting all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. This is such a good passage because it shows us what humility is all about.ÿ You see it says, ""Humble yourself before Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. casting all your anxieties upon him.""ÿ That's what humility is, to acknowledge your weaknesses.ÿ To admit you have problems, anxieties, shortcomings. Pride is to pretend you have it together.ÿ It's false.ÿ It's a lie. But humility is to admit the truth.ÿ It's to say to God and others, ""I have problems.ÿ Here are my problems."" If you can work on your humility, then the implications for your control of anger will be tremendous.ÿ When you get into a conflict, you won't feel like you have to protect some image that's false anyway.ÿ You won't feel like you can't admit you're wrong.ÿ In fact, if you're a humble person, if you get in conflict with someone, you'll realize almost immediately that you may be wrong. You will still feel anger.ÿ But you'll realize that anger means you need to resolve with someone.

"Emotions - The Positive Emotions and How They Work In Our Life",1991-11-03,," <h1>Intro</h1> (From the skit) This little piece of humor is actually not too far from the truth.ÿ People's affections are fickle.ÿ I want to talk about why that is in a second.ÿ But first I want to talk about what these positive emotions are and what God thinks about them. <h2>What excitement is</h2> We labelled this teaching ""excitement and attraction"" because the idea is an emotion that is brought about when something is very appealing to you.ÿ You are drawn to it.ÿ And it gives you a feeling of energy. This could come from a situation, an opportunity, or a person.ÿ Often someone of the opposite sex gives us this feeling. So we're talking about a feeling of energy.ÿ You want to move towards that person, or event.ÿ If we talk about approach or avoidance, this is the approach feeling. Some of the symptoms might be things like day-dreaming--you like to think about whatever it is.ÿ You would make time, it would become a big part of your scedule.ÿ You would smile and other body-language signs of excitement.ÿ You would tend to talk about it, or enjoy talking about it. These are all symptoms of the feeling we are describing. <h2>There are degrees</h2> You could call exhileration, ""exhileration.""ÿ You could call excitement, ""excitement.""ÿ You could call feeling good, ""feeling good,"" as if they were all different emotions.ÿ But I prefer to think of these things as degrees.ÿ There are varying degrees of excitement or happiness.ÿ On the one hand there is the more subtle, positive feeling you might have about the weather.ÿ It's kind of an all-around good feeling. On the other hand, there is the jubilation you might feel about winning the lottery.ÿ It's maximum excitement. These are degrees of happiness. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I take my wife for example.ÿ I'm attracted to my wife.ÿ I'm excited about my wife.ÿ But there is a different quality to those feelings than, say, 8 years ago before we were married.ÿ I still dream about my wife.ÿ I still daydream about her.ÿ I know that she dreams about me, but she usually wakes up angry at me because I did something bad in the dream. But there is a deeper quality to our happiness about each other today.ÿ It is more subtle, but it is also much more strong.ÿ At the high end of the excitement spectrum, those feelings come fast and furious, but they also leave just as fast.ÿ They are volatile.ÿ At the other end are happy feelings that take time to build.ÿ But when they are built, they last.ÿ They're strong. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember when we were dating.ÿ One date we went on was over to my house, to paint a wall--actually a couple walls.ÿ She seemed to agree to this.ÿ But when we got there and started painting, she went over and sat on the couch!ÿ When we finished hanging out, I had to wonder whether I wanted to date someone who wouldn't do what I wanted to do!ÿ What do we have in common anyway?ÿ She tells me that she was wondering whether to date someone who wanted to paint walls on our time together. That was a real crisis.ÿ Our relationship came this close to falling apart.ÿ But what would happen today if something similar occured?ÿ Not much. So, the subtle end is not as intoxicating.ÿ But, it is stronger.ÿ The high end is quicker, but it is more unstable and fleeting. So, there are degrees of excitement or happiness.ÿ Let's talk about some of the terms the Bible uses to discuss this topic. <h1>Biblical terms</h1> <h2>Happiness</h2> There are some of the expected terms, like happiness.ÿ God likes happiness.ÿ In this case, the Bible recommends that we express it.ÿ A passage like Jamesÿ5:13, Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise. So, let it out!ÿ Express it. You'll find the Bible is real into expressing this kind of emotion.ÿ And we'll talk about that in a minute. <h2>Blessed</h2> Another term that our translations use that is so far out of date that people don't even know what it means is the term ""blessed.""ÿ Now what if you started using that one in everyday speach? But the term means ""to be happy,"" or ""to be satisfied.""ÿ It's not in that thrilling sense where you might be blubbering all over the place.ÿ It's the kind of positive feeling that comes when things are right.ÿ It's well-being.ÿ It's a positive state of mind. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I were to use blessed in everyday speach, then I might say something like, ""If you excercise and eat the right food, then you will be blessed.""ÿ It means that you will have a generally happier disposition. A good example of how the Bible might use this term would be Prov.ÿ3:13, How blessed is the man who finds wisdom, And the man who gains understanding. It is because you have understanding, wisdom, that you are happy.ÿ You can see it's on the subtle end of the spectrum. What's important, as with all the more foundational positive feelings, it has to be built.ÿ You cultivate it. <h2>Joy / Rejoicing</h2> But by far the most common term for what we are describing is the term ""joy"" and ""rejoice.""ÿ These terms are used hundreds of times in the Bible.ÿ So the notion of joy is no small theme. Basically this idea of joy is what we're talking about tonight.ÿ Because sometimes joy is sometimes very powerful and expressive.ÿ In the Bible, it is a term used to describe outbursts of singing and praise to God.ÿ Psa.ÿ98:4 is typical, Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music You can see that the idea here is some outrageous expression of excitement.ÿ It's the kind of expression that probably most of us here would be embarassed by. On the other hand, the term joy is used to describe the more subtle feeling of contentment--a positive attitude.ÿ Paul prays that people will have a joyous attitude that kind of flavors their whole life.ÿ In Rom.ÿ15:13, May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. He's not saying that he wants them to go around singing songs and leaping.ÿ This is kind of an overall attitude that Paul is praying for. Look, it's interesting again.ÿ Look at the language.ÿ You will be filled with this joy and peace, as you trust in God.ÿ The language is of a process again. We could say a whole lot about excitement and happiness tonight.ÿ But what I want to focus on is the difference between how we look at happiness and how God looks at it.ÿ Because there is quite a difference there. <h1>Excitement as a goal vs. a result</h1> Specifically, I want to look at the type of person who looks at excitement as a goal in itself, versus the way God looks at it--as a by-product or a result of other things. Now I know there are lots of people who hardly every really pursue excitement.ÿ Maybe it's scary for them.ÿ Maybe they are very skeptical about happiness.ÿ But I hope that will be addressed just a little in the course of this talk.ÿ the main thing I want to talk about, though, is the very common mistake we make of pursuing happiness as a goal in itself. Right away, we should point out that Americans consider it a matter of duty to pursue happiness.ÿ Doesn't the Constitution itself guarentee us the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? So, there it is.ÿ We're supposed to.ÿ But God's approach is very different.ÿ He wants us to have joy and happiness.ÿ Jesus considered this a crucial part of his mission. <h2>God wants us to have it</h2> In Johnÿ15:11, Jesus said this, I have told you this so that my joy will be in you and so that your joy will be complete. He says that he wants their joy to be complete, or as full as it can be.ÿ I want to get into the context of this passage in a second.ÿ But what I want you to see is that God says, ""I want your happiness to be at the maximum."" Lots of people are familiar with the Beatitudes.ÿ These are ten sayings in Matt.ÿ5, where Jesus says, ""Blessed are these and those people.""ÿ As you know now, that term refers to a joyous attitude.ÿ Jesus is describing to people how to be happy in life. In Gal.ÿ5:22, Paul says that God produces in our lives, ""Love, joy and peace.""ÿ Those are the first three things that Paul mentions as the byproducts of God's work in our lives.ÿ The terms joy and peace are right in line with the positive feeling that we are discussing here. Beyond these passages, there are literally dozens and dozens of other passages in the Bible about how God wants to give us happiness and the secret of joy. <h2>How do you picture God</h2> But you know what's remarkable about all this?ÿ If you were to get a picture of God in your mind, and I asked, What emotion would you associate with God? I'll bet not many of us would say ""joy"" or ""happiness."" Think of it, God (get him on visual), how does he look? He looks serious, maybe even angry. You would never get a picture of God that says, ""I want you to have happiness and excitement in life!""ÿ With a big smile on his face?! And yet, as these passages make clear, this is no small theme in the Bible.ÿ God really longs for us to experience excitementÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>I'm a big excitement fan</h2> I think about myself and happiness.ÿ And I have to realize that I'm a big excitement fan.ÿ I love excitement.ÿ I crave it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some of my peers sat me down recently and told me that I need to avoid breaking the law.ÿ That might sound weird to some of you.ÿ A pastor needs a lecture on refraining from breaking the law.ÿ It's because they know I'm an excitement junkie.ÿ I'm not saying that I have broken the law, mind you.ÿ But the fear exists that I might go places that are exciting, but not allowed.ÿ Or, that I might try something that is too risky. I love excitement. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's for this reason that I can hardly stand teachings.ÿ How can you guys sit there?ÿ Doesn't it kind of make you ancy?ÿ Don't you start wondering, ""When is this guy going to shut up?""ÿ I do.ÿ It's just lucky that I wound up on this side of the microphone. But I do what a lot of other people do.ÿ I hunt for excitment as a end in itself.ÿ What that is, is self-defeating.ÿ Because it wasn't meant to be that way by the creator of this emotion. <h2>A fleeting goal</h2> The problem with pursuing happiness as an end in itself is that as an emotion, it has not substance.ÿ It was meant to be a response to deeper factors in our lives.ÿ Good feelings, especially, were intended to be carefully built.ÿ It's something that is supposed to happen over time (as the scriptures we looked at indicated). Good feelings were not intended to stand on their own.ÿ They weren't intended to be just experienced without, like a shot in the arm, without careful building. (refer to mountain drawing) People try to shoot for the peak, without taking the time to build the foundation.ÿ God's ideal is to build positive emotions.ÿ He also wants you to experience the peaks.ÿ But he wants us to build the foundation. We come along and say, ""I want to feel the mountaintop!""ÿ And we may even succeed.ÿ But then, it's a long way down.ÿ There's a price to pay. But also, what happens with emotions like happiness when you chase them is that they get harder and harder to catch. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you drink to get happy, then you have to drink more and more. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you have sex to get happy, then you get less and less from it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you chase money to get happy, then there's never a point when you have enough. Whenever you pursue happiness as a goal in itself, you will face these kinds of diminishing returns. <h2>Jesus saidÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Let's return to what Jesus said about joy.ÿ Remember he said in Johnÿ15 that he wanted us to experience maximum joy.ÿ But here's what he said before that, which is very important, If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy will be in you and so that your joy will be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. There is a very important point that Jesus is making here.ÿ He says ""if you obey my commandsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ <strong>Then</strong> he explains that he has said this so that our joy will be complete. So Jesus is saying, ""If you do what I say, then you will be happy.""ÿ But the real substance is what Jesus says.ÿ The real meat and potatoes is what Jesus tells us to do.ÿ And he says that in the next verse, (v.ÿ12). ""If you love each other as I have lovedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. then you will have happiness."" This is advice from the master.ÿ It's insight from the designer himself.ÿ We are on dangerous ground when we ignore it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In the Gremlins movie, the old Chinese guy who owned the gremlin sternly warned, ""Don't get water on this guy!""ÿ That advice was treated lightly, to the dismay of many. That is an old theme.ÿ The idea is that when the master tells you something about the way it works, don't take it lightly. Jesus is saying, ""I know the way to happiness.ÿ Here it is."" <h2>I've spent time depressed</h2> I've spent a lot of time in depression.ÿ Depression is kind of a funny thing.ÿ It's not what most people think, where you go around sad all the time.ÿ For some it might be that way.ÿ But for the most part, what it is is a lack of energy.ÿ It's a state where you lack the positive.ÿ You lack the drive.ÿ You lack the energy.ÿ Nothing excites you. My natural tendency in that situation is to go out looking for the positive feelings.ÿ I go for the happiness.ÿ I want the feeling. What I end up getting is a quick fix, that's over almost as soon as I get it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember last year I was recording TV shows, specifically documentaries.ÿ I get a good feeling from a documentary.ÿ I'm one of the only people I know who goes out and rents them.ÿ But I was kind of in one of these states.ÿ And my appetite got voracious.ÿ Everything looked good to me.ÿ A documentary on medicine?ÿ Good.ÿ A documentary on building skyscrapers!ÿ Great!ÿ Planes!ÿ But I would also watch shows about weasels, and the search for Bigfoot, and strange bugs attacking crops in the Midwest. When you get into that, and you're looking for that escape, that fleeting feeling, there's a letdown.ÿ I would watch one of my shows or indulge one of my other escapes and I would feel worse than before. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People who go out and get drunk feel worse than before. When people get into any one of these quick fixes, there is a letdown. Jesus says you have to build happiness.ÿ Jesus says it takes time to cultivate it.ÿ He says that the real thing is to get involved in love relationships, both with him and with other people.ÿ The other stuff is fake. <h1>Put the others aside</h1> I'm going to give you a radical idea.ÿ Something I want you to really think about.ÿ I'll just share my own discovery of what Jesus is talking about here. I remember when I first discovered it was at a time when the Lord made me realize just how hollow and unsatisfying all my other escapes and attempts at happiness really were.ÿ I was really hungry for true happiness.ÿ I was tired of all the fakes. I did something that was really scary to me.ÿ I told the Lord that I wanted to believe him, that true happiness comes from working on my love relationships.ÿ It's something that takes time to build.ÿ I committed, before the Lord, to put aside all my other forms of excitement--the cheap ones, the short ones, the fake ones--and to pursue his answer. I committed to doing that until I understood what he meant when he said that happiness is built by love.ÿ I didn't say a week.ÿ I didn't say a year.ÿ I didn't say any amount of time.ÿ I committed to putting things aside and working on my love relationships until I figured out what Jesus meant here. I put aside a lot of things.ÿ I put aside drinking.ÿ I put aside TV watching.ÿ I put aside listening to my stereo.ÿ I literally used to listen to it for hours a day!ÿ I put aside chasing women. And I took up pursuing my relationship with God, and my relationship with a few key people.ÿ I tried to build some close, loving relationships. I found out!ÿ I began to experience something that I fear not many have!ÿ It was real happiness.ÿ It built slowly at first.ÿ But it grewÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Over time, I felt the freedom to pick back up on the other forms of stimulation I had taken so much from.ÿ But I looked at them completely different from that day forward. Now, if you are saying, ""That sounds interesting, but I don't know how,"" then it is good that we are doing a series starting the week after nextÿ.ÿ.ÿ.

<h1>People's love will grow cold</h1>
<h2>Biblical predictions</h2>
Several months ago we finished a series on biblical prophecy.ÿ We got into a lot of remarkable predictions that the Bible makes about our time and things yet to come.ÿ But one that I left out or didn't discuss very much was in Matthewÿ24.ÿ It was a prediction of Jesus about the state of love in the world towards the end of history. Because of the increase of lawlesness, the love of most will grow cold (Matthewÿ24:12). This is one of the scariest predictions Jesus makes.ÿ The Bible foretells that there will be wars.ÿ But I figure I'll get by somehow.ÿ The Bible foretells about plagues and natural disasters.ÿ But I figure I'll make it.ÿ But this one, this one touches the issue of human relationships--something we all deal with from day to day. There are some other biblical predictions about this phenomenon.ÿ The apostle Paul puts it this way, But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.ÿ People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungratefulÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (2ÿTimothyÿ3:1, 2) The Bible predicts that there is going to be a moral decay in the world that is unprecedented.ÿ People will only think about themselves.ÿ And, as a result says Jesus, love will grow cold. I ask myself, Is this happening today?ÿ And as soon as I ask it I realize what a stupid question that is.ÿ What could be more obvious?! Now I realize that people have always complained that the moral standards of our country are eroding.ÿ And it has been a platform for many a reform and many a political candidate.ÿ But never have there been the kind of facts to back up that that we see today.
<h2>The facts</h2>
The generation born from 1961-1981, known as the children of the Baby Boomers, has a few problems: It is struck harder by divorce than any other generation.ÿ In fact, the difference with previous generations is outrageous, more than double.ÿ 40% of us were children of divorced families.ÿ An even greater percentage were latchkey kids.ÿ This means that we are unskilled at relationships, to say the least.ÿ Skeptical and cynical would be better terms. We are the most incarcerated generation.ÿ There are more of us in jail than any other culture has ever seen.ÿ They can't build jails fast enough to hold us. The rate of teen suicide is higher than any other generation in this century.ÿ Before that, stats were not reliable to it's hard to compare. But you add on top of that the moral confusion that we are faced with.ÿ It's incredible.ÿ Parents usually trust the schools to teach right and wrong.ÿ But here was a headline recently in a newspaper, ""Ethics Classes Avoid Teaching Right and Wrong."" Now, our parents say about that, ""What!?ÿ Ethics classes avoid teaching right and wrong!?""ÿ But I know exactly what that article is saying.ÿ I was there in school.ÿ And it wasn't just that they tried to avoid teaching right and wrong.ÿ They tried to tear down any concept of right and wrong that we might have had.ÿ I remember in classes have myself or one of the other kids raise our hands and say, ""Hey, this is the way it's gotta be!ÿ It's the right thing to do!""ÿ And then the teacher would say, ""Really?ÿ Who says?ÿ Are you aware that in such-and-such a culture they don't do it that way?ÿ Are you trying to say that they're wrong?!""ÿ They would deliberately hack away at any sense that there was a moral absolute. That's what our system does, whether it's the school system or the culture around us.ÿ It tries to instill in us that there are no ultimate values.ÿ Our culture says that your values and morals are OK as long as nobody gets hurt.ÿ That's pretty confusing. And you know what's worse?ÿ When we're steeped in that kind of teaching, people do get hurt.ÿ We don't know how to handle that kind of ambiguity. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Example</span></em>: There's the story of Rod Matthews.ÿ At the age of 14, he lured a friend into the woods, and then started beating him to death while he screamed for help.ÿ You think, ""Man, he must have really been angry at the guy!""ÿ But no.ÿ He did it because he wanted to see what death was like.ÿ He had been watching ""Faces of Death,"" and he wanted to see it live.ÿ At the trial, a psychiatrist testified that Rod was not insane in the usual way that you might consider insanity.ÿ The problem was that ""he didn't have a strong internal sense of right and wrongÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So that he is morally handicapped."" I know why that is.ÿ I tell you what scares me.ÿ I think I know other people who might do the same kind of thing if they weren't afraid of what would happen to them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Example</span></em>: A prosecutor being interviewed in US News and World Report said that the thing that scares him about the younger people he is working with today is that they have no value for human life.ÿ They don't give a hoot about it. These are examples that you may consider extreme.ÿ But I'll tell you that it is not unusual for people our age to not have the slightest idea of what is right and wrong.ÿ And even when people think that they know, they usually don't know why!ÿ And that means that's a pretty shakey foundation.
<h1>Why does Jesus say that our moral decline will mean a decline in love?</h1>
Jesus said because of this type of situation, love would grow cold.ÿ I know that something about it makes a lot of sense, just intuitively.ÿ But we need to look closer at why it is that Jesus says that love will grow cold because of a culture's moral decline. To understand this better, we'll look at a couple things that love needs to grow.ÿ You want to cultivate love between people, then there needs to be some ingredients there.ÿ When these ingredients are taken away when our life becomes so un-together, so damaged and broken in the moral area, it becomes virtually impossible to love.
<h2>Love needs trust</h2>
Love needs an atmosphere of trust to flourish.ÿ We can see this from a number of the passages which talk about love.ÿ But in IÿCor.ÿ13, there are several statements that describe what I'm talking about, Love is is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.ÿ It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. This is something most of us feel almost automatically.ÿ But let me say something that may kind of surprise you.ÿ I don't need to trust someone in order to love them.ÿ But, I will need to earn <em>their</em> trust in order for them to let me love them. Do you see the difference?ÿ Usually we think, ""Yeah!ÿ How can I love you if I can't even trust you!?""ÿ But that's not what I'm saying at all!ÿ What I'm saying is, How do you expect anyone to let you really love them if they can't trust you?ÿ They will always protect themselves. The Bible tells us in Johnÿ2, that Jesus didn't trust people.ÿ That doesn't mean that he always thought the worst and always judged people's motives.ÿ It just means that he saw people for what they were.ÿ As it says in that passage, ""He knew what was in people.""ÿ And yet, the Bible tells us that there has never been a greater love than the love that Jesus had for people.ÿ So you can deeply love people, even if they aren't trustworthy.ÿ Because love is something I do for you.ÿ It's not something I demand from you. On the other hand, if we set out to love people, how do we expect them to feel loved by us if they can't trust us--at least to a certain extent?ÿ They would always feel unsafe and guarded. A breakdown in trust happens two ways.ÿ For one, if your character is insincere, then that shows. This is definitely the greatest barrier between men and women.ÿ We have a hard time relating to each other because we can't help but suspect the hidden agenda.ÿ Why do you suppose it is that when you put a group together, they always divide up according to the sexes?ÿ It's because there's more safety there.ÿ There's just a slight degree more trust. I remember when I was single and still checking out the women.ÿ You might be at a place like this.ÿ And then every once in a while there was that real forward woman.ÿ I don't want to say there's anything bad about that at all.ÿ But I know what it made me think, ""Wow!ÿ What does she want!?ÿ What are her plans!?"" But the issue is that it's hard to open yourself to let someone love you if there is no trust.ÿ And it's really even harder in our culture because the morals in our society say it's OK to take whatever you can from a person and then move on.ÿ And in a relationship where there's no value in commitment, how much trust can there be? You know what happens?ÿ What happens is that we'll still have human relationships.ÿ In the case of men and women, we'll still have sex.ÿ Because we feel the need for human contact.ÿ But it won't be love, because there is no real trust.ÿ There will still be partnerships, but never truly deep.ÿ We'll still share something about ourselves, but never the real thing.ÿ Because love needs trust. So, love just get's shallower and shallower. But also, if I, as the receiver of love, am a very selfish person or a rip-off, then I will project that on to others and again make it impossible to trust people. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Example</span></em>: I remember when I came around this church here and heard all this talk about love.ÿ I heard teachings about it that sounded noble.ÿ I watched people act like they had it going on in their lives.ÿ But I didn't believe it.ÿ Not for one minute.ÿ ""There's no way!ÿ There's no such thing!"" I was reasoning from the way I was.ÿ I know I was self-centeredÿ.ÿ.ÿ.
<h2>Love needs sacrifice</h2>
Paul said that part of the moral decline will be that people will be lovers of self.ÿ Now, you have to realize it's hard to realize it stinks till you get off the farm, right? The point is that it may be hard for us to really appreciate just how self-absorbed our culture really is.ÿ We have a problem.ÿ We're so self-absorbed that when we look at a list like Paul's in 2ÿTim.ÿ3, about half those things we think, ""What's the big deal?"" Well, in order for love to really flourish, there has to be someone who loves to give.ÿ Love needs a person who sacrifices.ÿ Love needs a person who gives of himself to another. John says that sacrifice is an essential ingredient of love.ÿ IÿJohnÿ3:16 puts it this way, This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. Now Jesus really did lay down his life, literally.ÿ But John is saying that is the level of sacrifice we should be willing to give each other. Talk about a different moral standard: In our culture, we think just the opposite.ÿ A person who laid down his life for another person would be a sucker.ÿ You don't be going and sacrificing yourself for other people! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Example</span></em>: I admit I have a problem here.ÿ It's coming on Christmas time.ÿ What do I start thinking of?ÿ All the great things I can give people?ÿ Actually, the way it works in my mind is, ""How can I work it out so that I spend less on other people than they spend on me?ÿ And still get what I want?"" Over the years I've spent a lot of time trying to get people together, to develop love relationships.ÿ And you know what the biggest problem is?ÿ You know what the biggest barrier is?ÿ I'll be talking to someone and they'll say, ""He doesn't do anything for me.""ÿ He doesn't excite me.ÿ He's not fun enough.ÿ Whatever. We're all waiting for someone to love us!ÿ Talk about a frigid environment.ÿ Everyone is standing around with their arms crossed waiting!ÿ Now and then we venture out to see what we can get from someone else. And God is saying that love needs someone to sacrifice first.ÿ It needs someone who says, ""I'll sacrifice whether you do or not!""
<h1>What scares me: Cynicism</h1>
I know that sounds unreal.ÿ It sounds strange.ÿ And that's what kind of bothers me.ÿ What bothers me is the cynicism.ÿ It's that people think like I used to.ÿ There's a feeling out there that there really is no such thing as love. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Example</span></em>: I watch a movie like ""Pump Up the Volume,"" and his big thing was ""Life sucks.ÿ People are insincere.ÿ You can't trust anybody.""ÿ And he got popular because that's the way that people felt.ÿ ""Yeah!ÿ Life sucks!ÿ You can't trust anybody!""ÿ That proposition was never answered.ÿ And that's because it can't be answered.ÿ There is no answer.ÿ People really are only concerned about themselves.ÿ People are insincere. There is no hope of real love--that is, without the love of God. We said about this series that the love of God is unlike anything in the whole universe.ÿ And I really meant it.ÿ God's love is like this.ÿ God sees that we need help.ÿ God sees that things are screwed up around here.ÿ But you know what else he sees?ÿ He sees that we don't want help!ÿ He sees that we like doing things our way.ÿ He sees that we like running our lives. But in spite of that, God comes and gives his life for us.ÿ He comes to earth and dies for us.ÿ So that we could be forgiven.ÿ So that we wouldn't have to be judged for the things we do.ÿ God dies for us. Nobody asked him to.ÿ In fact, it was us humans who put him to death! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Example</span></em>: What could you compare this to?ÿ It's like someone rips you off.ÿ And then you go to the person and say, ""Hey, I forgive you.""ÿ And he starts beating on you, ""I didn't want your forgiveness, jerk!"" But he comes and he dies for us so that he can now turn to us and say, ""Here, take my forgiveness.ÿ Take my love.ÿ Take my acceptance.""ÿ Look at a great passage in It doesn't matter what kind of person you are.ÿ It doesn't matter what you do.ÿ It doesn't matter.ÿ God wants to love you!ÿ God wants to have a relationship with you. That's what we call unconditional love.ÿ Lot's of people talk about it, but who has ever really done it?ÿ God has. And people look at that, and they hear about that, and they say, ""No way!ÿ There's no way anyone would just love you and accept you for nothing!ÿ There has to be a catch!ÿ There has to be a price-tag!"" And that's the cynicism that I hate!ÿ I see it in myself.ÿ It's the cynicism that kept me from enjoying a good thing for so long!ÿ I said, ""There's no way!""ÿ I hate that!ÿ God is offering his love! Don't make the mistake of thinking that God is like you.ÿ If you want to get into love for what it was really meant to be, then open yourself up to let God love you first. And he says that we can experience it and with time, learn to give it to others. We need idealists.ÿ We need people who won't settle for less.ÿ We need people who say, ""I want to experience the real thing!""",,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Relationships - Buck McCallum",
"Relationships: God's Love is Forgiving",1991-11-17,," <h1>Issues to address</h1> Just how forgiving God's love is Why we never feel the need for forgiveness One of the main things that comes up between people <h1>Texts I could use:</h1> Luke 7:36ff. Hebrews 12:15 Ephesians 4:32 <h1>Why is forgiveness good?</h1> When I talk about the issue of forgiveness, I'm aware that not everyone agrees that forgiveness is even a good thing.ÿ Lot's of people think that getting even is better than forgiving. The problem here is that these people don't feel like they need to be forgiven themselves.ÿ I don't like to be in the business of persuading people that they are in need of forgiveness.ÿ I find it just makes people angry.ÿ It got Jesus in so much trouble, they killed him. On the other hand, it's exciting to see someone who does know they are forgiven. <h2>Luke 7</h2> There's a story in Luke 7 which shows what I'm talking about, the contrast between someone who knows that they need forgiving and someone who doesn't. (Read v.ÿ36, 37) Let's stop right there.ÿ It says that there was a woman in that town who was a sinner!ÿ What does this mean to say that she was a sinner?ÿ Does it mean that she was one of the only people who sinned?ÿ Not at all.ÿ What it means is that she was known that way.ÿ She knew herself that way, and others knew her that way.ÿ ""There's a sinner,"" they might say.ÿ ""I'm a sinner,"" she might say. Other people wouldn't want to say that about themselves.ÿ How does it fit with you?ÿ Can you say, ""I'm a sinner?""ÿ I find it's actually kind of fashionable today.ÿ But what's key is to understand what you mean by that.ÿ Do you mean, ""I'm cool, and do things that are kind of dirty?""ÿ Or, do you mean, ""I do things that are wrong.ÿ I'm the kind of person who needs forgiveness?"" Which is it for you? Because unless you're the second type--the type who knows ""I need forgiveness--it will be next to impossible for you to really appreciate God's love, as this story makes clear. (Read v.38)ÿ Why did she do this?ÿ This is so embarassing!ÿ She did it because Jesus taught something that blew her away.ÿ Jesus taught forgiveness.ÿ Jesus taught that God forgives.ÿ Apparently this was so moving that she kind of got emotional here.ÿ The onlookers thought that she was getting out of hand too (read through v.ÿ48). So, you can see the issues here.ÿ The one person disgusted, because he doesn't feel like the situation warrants this outburst.ÿ And he certainly doesn't understand why Jesus would associate with someone who admits she is a sinner. And then there is the woman, who knows that forgiveness is no small issue.ÿ And Jesus states a powerful principle in v.ÿ47, ""The one who is forgiven muchÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ That saying was just a twinge sarcastice, as many of Jesus' sayings were.ÿ He's not saying, ""There are two types of people in the world, people who need a lot of forgiveness and people who need a little.""ÿ There's no such thing as people who only need a little forgiveness.ÿ But there are plenty of people who feel that way. This is like Jesus' saying in other places where people challenged him, ""Hey, what are you trying to say!?ÿ What's your message Jesus!?""ÿ And he would say, ""Hey, don't worry about it.ÿ I came for people who are sick and need a doctor.ÿ So if you're well, no sweat!""ÿ And it would leave people with that feeling, ""I think he's trying to tell me something."" ""What have I done wrong?!""ÿ ""What's the big deal?!""ÿ ""Why do I need forgiveness?!""ÿ That's the attitude Jesus is driving at.ÿ With that kind of attitude, what motivation would there be for thankfulness? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember I was confronted by a guy whom I had offended somehow.ÿ And he came up and said, ""Hey Buck, just wanted to let you know that I've been really struggling withÿ your attitudeÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ But I've been able to pray about it and I think the Lord has given me the power to forgive you.""ÿ ""OK, thanks!""ÿ What was I supposed to say?ÿ I didn't feel like I needed his forgiveness.ÿ I may have, but I didn't feel like it! That's about how much sense it makes to some people to hear that God forgives them.ÿ ""Gee, that's nice.ÿ But, what's the big deal?"" All I can say about that is that someone who feels that way is so far out of touch--there's a rude awakening coming some day. <h2>Why ""loves much""?</h2> Of course, the worst thing is, that someone who feels that way can love very, very little.ÿ In other words, a person who is not deeply aware of their own need for forgiveness lives a loveless life. That's what Jesus says here.ÿ I find it to be scary.ÿ Because I, most of the time, don't feel like I need very much forgiveness.ÿ Does that mean that I have very little love in my life when I feel that way?ÿ Yes.ÿ That's what it means. Someone who doesn't believe they need very much forgiveness is proud.ÿ Someone who doesn't believe he needs very much forgiveness is hard.ÿ Someone who doesn't believe he needs very much forgiveness isn't aware of how he affects people.ÿ If I really knew how I affected people, I would be agonizing for forgiveness.ÿ I couldn't sit there and say, ""What's the big deal?"" Right there is the main reason for what Jesus said.ÿ A person who doesn't think they need very much forgiveness would never go to God and say, ""God, help me!ÿ I can't do it!ÿ I can't love people!ÿ I'm terrible at it!"" And love is something that is supernatural.ÿ Love is something that comes from God.ÿ Love is something we cannot do on our own.ÿ That's why it's so rare!ÿ It's so rare, that chances are good a person could go through their whole life and not really encounter someone who can really love. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have a relationship with my mother that's probably not too unusual for someone in our culture.ÿ She's mom. Actually, she's ""the old lady,"" as us kids affectionately call her.ÿ And I go out to see the parents regularly.ÿ But, you know how it is.ÿ Kid's don't run back to the house to hang with the family at every opportunity.ÿ Well, I started to notice that whenever I was out there people would be coming over to talk to her.ÿ And they would call.ÿ And as I was leaving, someone else would be showing up to spend time with the Old Lady.ÿ This was puzzling to me.ÿ Because my mom is quite old now.ÿ And here these people like 20 years old are coming to spend time!ÿ So I finally asked somene, ""Why do you suppose that is?""ÿ And the answer was, ""Because she has a lot of love to give."" That struck me.ÿ I realized that love is so rare, that you can sit there and it's like you're a magnet.ÿ People want to be with you.ÿ It's so rare. And it's forgiveness--forgiveness is the spark that starts love burning in someone.ÿ Until someone is stricken by his need for forgiveness, their heart is hard and cold. <h2>How can I see my need?</h2> I can't do anything to you to make you see your need for forgiveness.ÿ This is a matter of your heart--whether it will be hard or soft, proud or humble.ÿ It's something that you have to be into and want.ÿ It's something that God has to bring about in your life. But you know what's funny.ÿ People pray, ""Oh God, I want to be able to love people more.""ÿ Or, they pray, ""Oh God, I would like a heart of gratitude."" And then God answers that prayer.ÿ And we walk around saying, ""I'm such a screw up.ÿ I've got so many problems.ÿ I don't see God working in my life at all!""ÿ I just want to scream, ""Don't you see it!ÿ That is God at work in your life!""ÿ God is the great exposer.ÿ He reveals the truth.ÿ He shines a light in dark places to reveal just how dark they are! It's not that God causes problems in our lives.ÿ He only reveals things that are already there. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People who don't have God working in their lives are like the ""king with no clothes.""ÿ They're struting around, ""Hey!ÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" That is sad.ÿ Someone who knows about their problems and is acutely aware of them, well, we may feel sorry for them but we shouldn't.ÿ God is at work in that person's life.ÿ They may be naked but at least they're staying in their bathroom.ÿ What's sad is people who are clueless. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have a lot of opportunity to talk to people about problems and issues.ÿ So sometimes I'll be talking to someone and ask them, ""Do you think you have a problem in this area?""ÿ And they'll say, ""Not at all!""ÿ And I have to look away!ÿ Because it's hard to keep the smirk off my face!ÿ I'm looking at the king with no clothes. If God is showing you how deep your problems are, let me suggest to you that you thank him.ÿ ""Thank you God for revealing to me things that I could never face on my own.ÿ Thank you for your forgiveness!"" And that humility is going to become a spark to start real love in your life.ÿ You're not going to say, ""Hey, I can love people.""ÿ You'll pray, ""God, help me love people.""ÿ You won't say anymore, ""Hey, I think I can love people OK.""ÿ You'll say, ""I can't.ÿ I stink at it!""ÿ And the people you hurt, or the people you never have any effect on at all, will say, ""That's right.""ÿ But that's where love starts. <h1>I never thought I had a problem with forgiveness</h1> I've talked about God's forgiveness, and how that is a catalyst for our own love.ÿ But I do want to talk about forgiving each other.ÿ I'm not going to be able to spend a lot of time on it.ÿ But, fortunately, there is a nice paper on this subject at the back of the roomÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I don't have a problem with forgiveness.ÿ I'm basically an easy-going guy.ÿ When I look at people who have wronged me, I don't feel any feelings of hatred. Sure, when I get hurt or wronged, I get angry like the next guy.ÿ Sometimes I think about it several times.ÿ But eventually it gets worked out and I just get over it! These are things that I really thought about myself!ÿ I believed them about myself!ÿ What's funny is that people who know me say I've always tended to be a little bit negative about myself.ÿ So, I'm going to bet that a lot of us here feel the same way. A couple things happened to change my mind.ÿ First, I was counseling once, getting some marriage counseling in fact.ÿ We were just sitting there talking about other people.ÿ And as people's names would come up, I would say, ""Oh yeah!ÿ That's the guy who didn't pay his rent and got thrown out of his house!""ÿ Then we'd be talking about someone else and I'd say, ""Oh yeah!ÿ She's the girl who dumped that one dude and then we found out later that she was dating someone else all along!""ÿ ""Really!?ÿ When?""ÿ ""Oh, about 4 years ago."" And this guy who was counseling with us said, ""You never forget, do you?""ÿ ""What do you mean?""ÿ ""You never forget when someone screws up!""ÿ And my mouth just dropped because I didn't picture myself that way!ÿ I did not see myself as someone who doesn't forget.ÿ I saw myself as someone who says, ""Live and let live.ÿ We all screw up in many ways."" Then I started to notice.ÿ It's not that I hated people who did me wrong.ÿ I didn't sit around growling about them.ÿ I just excised them from my life!ÿ I eliminated them!ÿ I refused to associate with them any more! My basic message to them was, ""Fine.ÿ You're an idiot.ÿ You can hang with all the other idiots in this world.ÿ I'm movin' on!"" I started to see myself as the vengful, unforgiving person that I am.ÿ And it was an ugly picture. It's a picture I'll bet a lot of us here aren't willing to accept about ourselves.ÿ But you just need to think about the people in your life who have wronged you--really hurt you.ÿ Think about how you treat them now versus how you treated them before. Of course we can explain it all away.ÿ ""I'm just protecting myself.ÿ He's hurt me too much.ÿ So I have to keep my distance."" <h1>The Bible says we are unforgiving</h1> God, in the Bible, says that we have a problem with forgiveness.ÿ And he says it with characteristic clarity. <h2>Titus 3:3</h2> We too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. This is Paul the apostle, admitting that before he understood God's forgiveness he lived in hatred.ÿ That was a way of life. <h2>IÿCorinthians 3:3</h2> You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? When Paul says that they are ""worldly"" he is just saying that they are acting like the rest of the people in this world.ÿ As he says, ""You're acting like mere men.""ÿ Nothing could be more typical of people than strife and division. <h1>It's hard for us to see it</h1> I think that it's hard to see just how deep the problem of being unforgiving is until you start to fight against it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I started to take this issue seriously I saw this about myself.ÿ Someone would say, ""Hey Buck, how're you getting along with so-and-so?""ÿ ""Great!ÿ No problems at all!""ÿ ""How long has it been since you've seen him?""ÿ ""Uh, wellÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" I don't have any statistics, but I think this kind of thing--a failure to really forgive--is what drives more people apart than any other thing. I don't have a lot of time to get into the practicals of forgiveness.ÿ Like I said, there is a paper on it in the back if you want more.ÿ But I can leave you with a few thoughts about it. Like I've been talking about tonight, it starts with realizing that I need forgiveness.ÿ This is becoming a Christianÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But it's more than that.ÿ You also have to realize that you have wronged that person--the person you are angry at.ÿ This is true in almost every single case.ÿ You have also wronged them somehow.ÿ I don't care what the balance is, what the score is, what the ratio is.ÿ That's not the point.ÿ The point is to admit, ""I have also wronged him.""ÿ And get specific. This is such an important step.ÿ Because the fact is, we can sometimes get angry and outraged at a person in order to keep ignoring what we've done.ÿ It helps us keep our eyes off our own problems. Can you enumerate the things you've done wrong to that other person?ÿ Usually this means you haven't even started to forgive them yet, because you haven't seen your own problems. That goes for about 90% of the cases where there is hostility between people.ÿ There is a small percentage of the cases where we are just victims.ÿ But even there, God can help us forgive. <h2>Acknowledge just how wrong they were</h2> Now there's a step in here that some people have a harder time with than others.ÿ I think the reason might be that sometimes seeing just how wrong someone has been can be threatening to us, especially if they are family or something. But let's just put it this way: You can't forgive someone for something they didn't do.ÿ And if you minimize what someone did, then you are never forgiving them.ÿ You may think you are.ÿ But you'll still feel uncomfortable around that person because you forgave them for the wrong thing! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If my wife is cruel and beats me up, then I could say, ""Sometimes she gets a little out of hand but it's OK."" That's not forgiveness. <h2>Begin to pray</h2> Notice I don't say, ""Pray.""ÿ That gives the impression that it will happen after once.ÿ Theÿ idea is that you have to start to talk this over with Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Begin to love</h2> Trying in your heart is not enough.ÿ You have to start to do something positive for that person. Jesus said, ""Bless those who persecute you!""ÿ Paul said, ""Return good for evil!""ÿ You have to begin to do positive things for that person. And in this case, the maxim is true: Your heart will follow your actions.ÿ You will start to feel better about that person because you are loving themÿ.ÿ.ÿ. &nbsp;",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04272.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Relationships - Buck McCallum",
"Relationships: God's Love is Tough",1991-11-21,," <h1>What is ""tough love""?</h1> It's a big deal these days.ÿ People talk about ""tough love,"" they talk about confrontations and interventions and so on.ÿ But I think there is a lot of confusion on what we're really talking about here. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I step on my dog's paw or tail, she growls at me. So, when someone does you wrong, and you let them have it, then you're right up there with doggies and kitties.ÿ That's not what we're talking about at all.ÿ Although I agree that it can be important to let someone know when you've been hurt, that is not the tough love that the Bible portrays. <h2>""Training""</h2> The Bible uses one term which means ""training.""ÿ It is seen as part of love.ÿ In other words, we can talk about how God's love is forgiving, like last week.ÿ We can talk about how God's love is positive and encouraging.ÿ But his love is also directive.ÿ He loves us, so he ""guides"" us or ""trains"" us.ÿ The idea is that he sees what will be good for us and kind of steers us in that direction. You may know that many of the translations of the Bible translate this word as ""discipline.""ÿ I didn't use that word at first because of all the negative connotations.ÿ There are many.ÿ Most folks can't tell the difference between discipline and punishment.ÿ There is a huge difference. Punishment is negative reinforcement.ÿ In the course of training someone, you will use some of that.ÿ But it is only a part. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I get into sports, then I will endure training under a coach.ÿ What do coaches do?ÿ Let you run around and then when you screw up, ""Hey!ÿ McCallum!ÿ 20 laps!""ÿ Not at all.ÿ The training a coach uses us totally positive.ÿ He puts you through things.ÿ He tests you.ÿ He teaches you.ÿ And, yes, he will also punish you.ÿ A coach can punish for all kinds of reasons.ÿ He may see a habbit that needs broken.ÿ He may see defiance.ÿ But hopefully, at the bottom of it, it's not just because you somehow irritated him or he's a grouchy guy.ÿ Hopefully it's to make you a better athelete. I think this is a good illustration.ÿ It is biblical for one thing. <h2>Hebrews 12:9-11</h2> We had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, that we may share His character. All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. I want to focus on two aspects of this passage.ÿ The first is that we are accustomed to some form of discipline, from authorities here on earth.ÿ The author makes the assumption that we respected them, which is not a safe assumption anymore.ÿ But he makes this point: They disciplined us as seemed good to <strong>them</strong>. You have never seen or experienced the kind of directive love that God has.ÿ It is a love that is for our good.ÿ He doesn't ask, ""Is this guy making me happy or not?ÿ Is this guy making me look good?ÿ Is this guy embarassing me?ÿ Is he getting on my nerves""ÿ All the things that self-centered authorities ask. And it is true that even when a parent disciplines their child for what we might consider a right reason, there are often self-serving motives mixed in.ÿ Motives like their own image or their own vision for youÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember watching some parents punish their kids for grades--we're not talking D's and F's here.ÿ We're talking B's, maybe even A-'s.ÿ And you have to think to yourself, ""I'm not so sure that they're looking out for the kid's best interest at that point. But it says here God is different.ÿ God alone looks out completely for our interests.ÿ This is where the study of God is so important before we can understand something as completely different as God's love. He doesn't have a fragile self-image. He doesn't need anything from us. He doesn't have a temper problem. He's not afraid that if he loves, we won't love him back. He's not afraid of being hurt.ÿ He can take that. God is completely different.ÿ That's why his love is completely different.ÿ And he tells us here that whatever he does for us, it is completely for our good. But the second thing I want you to see about this notion of discipline is that the author equates it with training.ÿ He says, ""Those who have been trained by itÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ That's the idea we have been talking about.ÿ God's love is aimed at training us, shaping us, trying to refine us. So the idea of tough love from God's point of view is very different.ÿ We see it as reacting to a problem. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I will confront you if your alcoholism is destroying our family! Good!ÿ But God's is much more than that. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I will confront you if I feel you are taking advantage of me. OK, even that might be OK.ÿ But God's love is more than that.ÿ More often than not, God lets us take advantage of him.ÿ There is no one in the universe who gets taken for granted, taken advantage of, and just taken from than God.ÿ But he doesn't thrash on us for that.ÿ He carefully picks issues to bring up with us that will be for our good.ÿ To make us better. So, God's love is different.ÿ It is long term.ÿ He looks at our character and says, ""How can I shape that person?ÿ For their good?""ÿ There is absolutley no self-seeking. <h2>We should seek it out</h2> So, in that light, the Bible tells us that correction and training is something we should actually seek out.ÿ As Proverbsÿ12:1 says, Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge.ÿ But he who hates reproof is stupid. We're supposed to grow to love correction and training.ÿ In fact, Proverbsÿ15 says that the one who tries to avoid discipline hates himself, He who neglects discipline despises himself.ÿ But he who listens to reproof acquires understanding. Really a different point of view isn't it?ÿ We'll talk about that in a second. But I want to point out that the Bible tells us not only to seek out God's correction, but to also seek out correction from others, and to seek to give it to others.ÿ In other words, we should be doing with each other what God does with us.ÿ That is a point of application I want to draw out in this teaching here.ÿ We should be involved in this kind of correction and ""tough love"" with each other. Just to look at a couple of Bible passages which teach that: Proverbsÿ19:20 Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days. Romansÿ15:14 I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to admonish one another. The term ""admonish"" is a term that gets at what we're talking about hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Matthew 18:15 ""If your brother sins, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. Here again, the idea is that if you see a weakness, then you can help someone.ÿ See how the goal here is not to just point out his error.ÿ It's not to make make him sad.ÿ It is to win your brother over. So, with these passages and many others, the Bible is encouraging us to get into this idea of correction and training.ÿ We are to seek it out from God.ÿ We are supposed to seek it out from others.ÿ We are supposed to give it to others. <h1>Why should we get into this anyway?</h1> But it's painful.ÿ No matter what you call it, it's painful.ÿ There are moments of ""negative reinforcement.""ÿ Coach says, ""Take a bench.""ÿ But there are also times of purely positive training, ""Let's run 100's.""ÿ Nobody jumps for joy. And our point of view is that pain is bad.ÿ Painful things should be avoided if at all possible.ÿ So, I ask, why should we get into this? There are a couple good reasons: <h2>It shapes our character</h2> Obviously the big reason is that loving discipline improves our character, in just about every way.ÿ And here's where the Proverb's point is so strong.ÿ ""The person who is not into this, hates himself."" You have no vision for being different.ÿ If everything were OK, if you were fine just the way you are right now, then you wouldn't need any shaping.ÿ You wouldn't need any discipline. On the other hand, nobody is fine just as they are.ÿ And to avoid discipline is to say, ""I don't see much more in me.ÿ I don't have much more that could be drawn out.ÿ I don't think it's worth it to go through trouble because there's nothing there!ÿ I don't think I can get over this problem or this weakness."" The fact is, loving discipline says you can get over that problem.ÿ You can achieve more.ÿ You have much more that hasn't even been seen yet. God has had to work with me extensively by way of discipline, especially negative reinforcement.ÿ Because my way is to cope.ÿ I find a nice little rut and occupy it.ÿ If I have a problem, then I learn to deal with it.ÿ But God says, ""No way!ÿ You can get over it!""ÿ And he starts to bring pressure to bear in my life to make me deal with it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I had a problem with women, where I would either be blatantly on the take--trying to selfishly use a woman somehow--or I would avoid them altogether.ÿ So here's a whole half of the human race that represented either people to use, or if you weren't going to do that, then they were useless.ÿ And God made me miserable.ÿ God brought pressures to bear on me that made me miserable.ÿ He brought people into my life who confronted me on the issue.ÿ I believe he brought pressure to bear on my emotions, alerting me to the fact that I had a real problem (I think God can use our emotions as a tool of discipline in our lives.ÿ He can use our emotions to bring pressure to bear, to give us a sense of urgency and rouse us out of our rut.)ÿ He can use circumstances to make things rough.ÿ As he did with me, he brough women into my life who said basically, ""I won't be treated this way.""ÿ And I tried to avoid the issue.ÿ I tried to pretend it wasn't there.ÿ But God kept bringing it up until I was willing to deal with it. That's what I mean when I say that loving confrontation sees your potential. <h2>It makes us feel loved</h2> And that brings me to our last point about loving correction and training: It is one of the main ways we <em>feel</em> loved.ÿ Why should I get into it?ÿ Why should I seek it out?ÿ Why should I give it to others?ÿ Because it's one of the main ways we feel loved. We have talked about this a lot.ÿ We've talked about how people don't feel loved.ÿ We've talked about how people feel lonely.ÿ You may have people in your life who try to love you quite a bit, but somehow we still may not feel loved. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This will happen with kids quite a bit.ÿ They may have parents who do things for them, say, ""I love you,"" show affection, and do a lot of things right.ÿ But that kid may still feel unloved by his parents. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Likewise, in a relationship, I may be as pleasant as a spring day to you.ÿ I may smile and greet you warmly whenever I see you.ÿ I may pat you on the back and tell you how great you're doing.ÿ But I will guarentee that you will still not feel very loved by me. How do I know?ÿ Because I know the people who make me feel loved.ÿ I know about people who take the time to think about me and bring things up with me.ÿ I know the people who see my potential and aren't content to just leave me be. And I know how God has been with me.ÿ It was God's discipline in my life that convinced me that he loved me.ÿ I remember being stricken with the fact, ""He is trying to discipline me!ÿ Why me?!ÿ Why does he even bother?ÿ Why does he take the time?""ÿ And it struck me just how much God loves me. Revelationsÿ3:19, Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. When you see yourself or someone going through God's discipline, mark that person as priviledged.ÿ God is loving that person. And it is one of the main ways we show love for each other.ÿ I know some of you out there may consider yourselves to be a loving person because you're positive with people.ÿ And that may be true to a certain extent.ÿ Others of us may consider ourselves OK with people because we never offend anyone.ÿ And that may be true to a certain extent.ÿ But do you realize this: That by the same token, you never make anyone feel loved. When we don't take the time to confront, then we're not taking the time to think about that person--thinking about how they could be better. When we don't take the time to confront, then we're not seeing the potential in that person. When we don't take the risk of confrontation, then we're saying that my personal feelings and fears are more important to me than you are. Think about it.ÿ That's a painful realization.ÿ ""I don't make anyone feel loved."" But this is one of the main reasons that we should get into correction and training with one another.ÿ It makes others feel our love for them.ÿ It helps us to see their love, and God's love, for us.

"Dealing with the Holidays: Family",1991-12-22,,"  Family <h1>Intro</h1> We're going to be talking about spending time with the family, with an emphasis on the holidays.ÿ We spend a lot of time during the holidays. Here's God's point of view on families: He made them to be a great blessing.ÿ He made families to be a source of happiness and fulfillment in our lives.ÿ Now, some of us don't have too hard a time believing this.ÿ Others can't believe anything good could come out of families. Now obviously, God is creative enough, he could have designed things a different way.ÿ He could have made us so that we grow on trees, or we divide in two.ÿ There are a hundred different ways he could have designed proliferation.ÿ He could have created each one of us from scratch.ÿ But he didn't.ÿ He decided that working through the family was the best way. <h1>Requires human interaction</h1> One reason I can see is that a family means that you have to have very meaningful and impactful relationships with other humans.ÿ The very structure of things--that we're born into this world helpless, and we can only grow up with the help of others--means that we have to have some serious relationships that matter. Even if you try to get out of it, if you try to run away from your family, it's too late.ÿ You've already been exposed to their influence in a very powerful way.ÿ And the same is true of them. Some folks feel like this is totally unfair.ÿ And I can't blame some people.ÿ I know that there are some seriously raunchy familes out there.ÿ But on the whole, God's view is that it's better to have things this way than not.ÿ God's view is that even with the defects and problems that the system has, it's good. <h2>Honor</h2> This is where the whole idea of ""honoring your father and mother"" comes in.ÿ It's one of the ten commandments.ÿ It's found many times in the Bible.ÿ For example, in Eph.ÿ6:1-3, Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.ÿ ""Honor your father and mother""--which is the first commandment with a promise--ÿ ""that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."" To ""honor"" your father and mother means to esteem them highly.ÿ It means to consider them worthy and worthwhile.ÿ It means to be grateful for them. So God is saying that they are worthwhile.ÿ They are good.ÿ They are worthy.ÿ We may not feel that way, but God does. Now we know that God is not ignorant about defective parents.ÿ He is realistic.ÿ He knows what really happens behind closed doors.ÿ For example, in the next verse, Paul says to fathers not to exasperate their children.ÿ He means, ""Don't drive them crazy.""ÿ He knows that kind of thing happens. But, the point is, more good is done by the institution of the family than bad. In fact, by far the greatest damage being done today is not from families.ÿ We hear about terrible families and the damage they do.ÿ I agree.ÿ There are some rotten things being done out there.ÿ But the greatest damage is being done by people who reject the family.ÿ That's where things are really getting screwed up.ÿ Parents who say it's not worth it.ÿ Kids who hate and reject their parents. It's a rejection of the family structure that is really hurting people. But the point here is, ""Consider your parents, consider your family worth-it.ÿ Esteem them highly.""ÿ And it's interesting that he says, ""If you do, your life will go well.""ÿ I think there are a lot of reasons for that.ÿ But our concern here tonight is how to better get along with your family. I am going to give two thoughts about getting along better. <h1>Coming to serve</h1> The first is connected to this idea of Eph.ÿ6:2, honoring your parents.ÿ This isn't just some kind of attitudinal thing, ""Hey, I think my parents are honorable.""ÿ It's something you do.ÿ The idea is that you go to serve your family. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: For example, in one place, Jesus interpreted this commandment as applying to giving your parents money. That is certainly one application.ÿ But the idea is that you are looking to serve your family. Now let's think about it.ÿ How do you go to hang out with your family?ÿ What are you looking for?ÿ Are you looking to serve them?ÿ I'll bet a lot of us think we are. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We were talking about this the other night and one of the guys said, ""Well of course!ÿ Of course I go to serve!""ÿ So we asked him, ""How?""ÿ Then came the blank look.ÿ What would have been even better would be to ask his family.ÿ ""How does he serve you?"" If we asked people, ""Why do you like to go home for the holidays?""ÿ They would have a variety of things that they get from their families. ""I like to go relax."" ""I like to get lots of food!"" ""I like to get presents!"" All of these are somewhat self-serving reasons.ÿ But they aren't at all uncommon.ÿ And I don't think that they're all that harmful. The problem is when we get into the unspoken, more powerful expectations we have about our family. I want them to make me feel better. I want them to make me feel worthwhile. I want them to make me feel important. I want them to listen to me! I want them to always be positive about the things I say. I want them to change, because they bother me the way they are. See?ÿ Now we're getting into the powerful expectations that are also very common, but unspoken.ÿ And it's these that cause a lot of trouble.ÿ Because of this simple fact: <strong>They will let you down</strong>. There are parents and brothers and sisters that are cruel.ÿ And there is often no changing that.ÿ There are parents and brothers and sisters who are cold and indifferentÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But what makes this worse is when we go to them with an expectation!ÿ That's what really causes a blowup. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I go to my father, and I feel like, ""Your affirmation is what I need to feel good about myself,"" and then he cuts on me instead!ÿ There's gonna be trouble! See, there are two things that cause trouble in families.ÿ The first is the fact that we screw up and hurt each other all the time.ÿ But the second is the fact that we won't tolerate it when others let us down!ÿ We won't forgive them.ÿ We blow up at them.ÿ We carry grudges.ÿ We react in kind, with various punishing behaviors. Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have all kinds of expectations on our families, so that we could be set free to go to them and serve? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember I lived with a guy who hated to go out to his family and spend time.ÿ He would avoid it for any reason.ÿ I started to get into it with him, ""Why do you hate it so much?""ÿ ""They do this to me and thatÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ What do you do to them?ÿ ""Nothing.""ÿ ""Well, that's the problem.ÿ You don't do anything to them!ÿ Why don't we sit here and decide what would be good to do to your familyÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ He came back and said he had the best time he could ever remember! But of course, if you are going to be able to do this with your family, then you need to be able to get the things you need from somewhere else.ÿ If your family isn't going to be the source of good feelings, if your family is going to be the one you get affirmation from, then you need to get it somewhere else. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: To think of it another way, you need to fill up yourself first, before you go driving off to serve your family.ÿ You need to be built up. And it's here that Jesus came and taught us an amazing thing.ÿ Jesus taught us that God wants to be our Father.ÿ And really, that's more impersonal than he said it.ÿ The term that he used was ""Dad.""ÿ Or, if you can still say it, ""Daddy."" Look at the kind of intimacy Jesus taught that God wants with us, Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.ÿ And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.ÿ (Matthewÿ10:29, 30) It's not just ""father,"" it's ""your father.""ÿ And he knows everything about you.ÿ And he wants to be involved in every aspect of your life.ÿ God wants the type of love relationship with us that should be between a parent and a child. Now I know what you're thinking.ÿ ""I don't need another dad.ÿ I'm fine.ÿ I'm fine."" Well, God really disagrees.ÿ He says that we do need a relationship with him.ÿ And we need it real bad.ÿ He says in IÿJohnÿ4:7, 8, Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. And again in v. 19, We love because he first loved us. He's saying that we don't understand very much at all about love until we meet the love of God.ÿ We really do need him. You can't go to your family, or to anyone for that matter, and have a heart to really love them without first experiencing what God has for you.ÿ God tells us this is the missing piece.ÿ This is why families aren't working.ÿ The love that defines them and energizes them is missing.ÿ People are trying to make do without it, and they're failing. Start by going to God and saying, ""I need to know your love.ÿ I need a relationship with you.""ÿ That is what it means to become a Christian.ÿ It's to come to God and say, ""God, even though I'm unworthy, even though I don't deserve it, can I have your forgiveness and can I have a relationship with you?""ÿ And God's answer is yes. And it's here that we'll find we'll be able to begin--begin I say-- having a serving relationship with family. <h1>Take responsibility</h1> I can give you one more thought on handling your family.ÿ And that is, face the facts and take responsibility for how you interact with them. We talk today about ""dysfunctional families"" like they are some kind of disease that strikes us.ÿ I've already said there are some real poor parents out there.ÿ I know that. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: But when you can't look your Dad in the eye, that's you who can't do that. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When you can't bring yourself to say anything positive about your brother or sister or mother, that's you. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I can't do anything but hate being there with them, that's me. No one is making you respond to these people the way you do. We deceive ourselves.ÿ We pretend we're OK.ÿ But fortunately, families have been given to us by God to tell the truth. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We say, ""I'm not the one with the problem.ÿ It's my dad who's the jerk!ÿ When I'm with other people I'm OK!""ÿ Which may be trueÿ.ÿ.ÿ. until you get your own family!ÿ And then that person goes out and does the same thing! We're fine, as long as we can be a little island.ÿ As long as we can have our protective space.ÿ But God has given us families to invade our space and expose the real truth. Today people are on the run from the notion of family.ÿ I'll tell you why.ÿ Because they hate to see the truth about themselves.ÿ Of course, there'll be a price to pay.ÿ Whatever their problems are, they'll just grow and growÿ.ÿ.ÿ. If you struggle with your family, if you can't bring yourself to serve.ÿ If you can't bring yourself to be positive.ÿ If you can't bring yourself to exert any energy.ÿ If you find yourself getting angry and hard to get along with.ÿ Then be thankful.ÿ Because you just learned the way you really are. ""Thank you God, for giving me my family to show me the way I really am.ÿ I needed that."" Thank God that he has given us families.ÿ I hope you'll think about what God is trying to show you about yourself this holiday when you're spending time with your family.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04318.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Holidays - Buck McCallum",

"Relationships: Building Deeper Friendships",1992-01-09,,"  <h1>Relationships and ministry</h1> I want to talk about our relationships here because there are very few things as foundational as this to the Lord's work.ÿ In fact, sometimes I wonder why even make a distinction between relationships and the Lord's work, because if we're conducting a biblical relationship with someone (practicing biblical love), then we are ministering. But there is a distinction.ÿ Because sometimes I can minister without a relationship.ÿ And we have had some worker's meetings on that issue.ÿ For example, often times we are ministering the Word of God.ÿ In these cases our relational contact with that person can be very shallow.ÿ In fact, when we teach, which is also ministry, we may not even know the people we are teaching to.ÿ So it is possible to have ministry without relationship.ÿ But let me go on and say, not very much ministry.ÿ Not very much at all. In IÿCor.ÿ13, where Paul talks about the uselessnes of knowledge, tongues, prophecy and even sacrifice without love, I think one of the things he is saying is that the real business isn't getting done without love.ÿ In order to truly be serving God and making an impact, we need love in our lives. <h2>Requires a friendship</h2> One thing I would like to establish right away is that in order to have biblical love practiced in our lives, this requires deep friendships.ÿ I say this because some people feel like they can love people, in general.ÿ But does love require depth and commitment to an intimate friendship? I know that people ask this question because I have asked it repeatedly myself.ÿ Do you really have to practice biblical love in the context of a close and commited friendship? Pro. 18:24 - A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.ÿ He is saying that a true friend is truly close and loyal--closer than a brother!.ÿ And that many of these cursory friendships we have may come to nothing. And of course there are the many descriptions of what is involved in a relationship which simply require commitment and loyalty.ÿ We'll get to some of these in a moment. <h1>A shortage of good relationships</h1> Before I go into saying a few things about relationships, let me say that there is always a shortage in this area.ÿ I mean, if we had it together in this area our church would be explosive.ÿ Jesus made the connection between effective witness to the world and our love for each other in Johnÿ13.ÿ I don't need to elaborate on this too much. The funny thing is, I ask home church leader after leader how they think the relationships are in their church.ÿ ""Do you think enough people have close relationships?""ÿ And the answer is almost universally, ""Yes, I think we are doing pretty good there.ÿ Our problem is with outreach.""ÿ Or, ""Our problem is with follow up.""ÿ And then I always feel a little bad because when I look at my church, and this is nothing new, I see a real shortage of the depth of relationship that I see described in the Bible. So, I begin to suspect that maybe this is something people are unaware of.ÿ Maybe we are using different standards when we say, ""I think the relationships are pretty good in our church."" Our standards need to be high in this area.ÿ Because if they aren't, then people will start getting the impression that this is something they can do--which is a most grevious mistake when it comes to relationships. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Take me for example.ÿ I have always been really bad at love relationships.ÿ But I'm actually glad for that.ÿ I'm glad because I've never been able to say to myself, ""Well at least I'm a loving person.""ÿ So many people tell themselves that.ÿ I was talking to one person lately (who would be upset if I used her name, but she lives in my house with me) and she said, ""I've always been good at relationships!"" Love relationships are impossible.ÿ Love, in the biblical sense, is the one thing in our life which definitely requires a miracle.ÿ If we think that the relationships are great in our church, that's one in the same with saying we've got a lot of people who are really walking in the Spirit. So, there is a strong case to be made for setting our standards real high.ÿ It calls people to pray, to be humble, to see their need for God's hand in their relationships. I want to talk about just a couple of things that I see rarely see happening enough in relationships.ÿ Obviously we could go on and on, but I just want to talk about a few things. <h1>Honesty</h1> Put the thing in here from Jourard (p.ÿ29 of F.F.). <h2>The Bible agrees</h2> Is this so according to the Bible?ÿ In fact, the Bibleÿ says precisely this. Ps. 32:3 - ""My bones wasted away,"" what a powerful way to talk about the effect of silence and secrecy.ÿ He is saying that his bones felt old, weary, worn out.ÿ He felt like he wanted to flop down in evey chair he saw.ÿ In the morning, he would feel sore at the thought of getting out of bed. And this is just from one sin!ÿ Some of us have a lifetime of secrets we are holding.ÿ Some Christians aren't honest with anyone!ÿ There's some real sadness going on there. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Now when some of these non-Christians or even Christians go around acting like their life is so good, that they are enjoying their money or their good times with women or men, don't you believe it for one second.ÿ They have only temporary relief.ÿ They have only moments of relief from the feeling that accompanies them all the time--and that is the feeling of the sinking heart or the weary bones.ÿ But they focus on those few moments of relief they get and pretend that's what their life is like. <h2>Some Christians dispute the need for this.</h2> Now if you're like me, or if you have worked with people like me, then you have found that some Christians doubt the need to be really honest about their problems and sins.ÿ There are a lot of people that feel the scriptures do not necessarily teach honesty with one another.ÿ Have you ever been challenged with this? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Even the passage we just read in Ps.ÿ32 can be construed to say that David was wasting away as long as his sin was unconfessed before God.ÿ Because David says, ""I finally acknowledged my sin to you.""ÿ However, if we recall the story itself, David was also exposed publicly.ÿ So his confession to God also involved exposure to people. Nevertheless, this passage is not where I would stake the case that there is a need for real honesty between us.ÿ I would simply point out from Ps.ÿ32 that dishonesty and hiding issues has the effect of wearing away at us. I think a couple very good passages on honesty are Heb.ÿ3:13 and James 5:16 I think the passage of James 5 is significant because v.ÿ16 is in contrast to what comes before.ÿ What comes before, you will remember, is a discussion of what should happen if someone is so ill that they need the prayer and attention of the elders of the church.ÿ So here is a situation where things have gotten so extreme that the elders have to be called in (I don't want to get into what might cause that.).ÿ The point is that v.ÿ16 starts, ""<strong>Therefore</strong> confess your sins to one another.""ÿ The ""therefore"" is used to resume, or infer something slightly different than that which preceeds it.ÿ James is saying, ""Rather than letting things get to the point of calling the elders, confess your sins and pray for one another to stay well."" The idea is that a regular diet of confession and prayer for one another is going to result in our well-being. Likewise, Hebrewsÿ3:13 is very important in our teaching of honesty.ÿ Note that he says we ought to encourage one another daily.ÿ And this is an excellent point in itself for saying that the majority of our work with each other ought to be building each other up and encouraging one another.ÿ But see the point of encouraging at the end of the verse, ""in order that no one is hardened by the decietfulness of sin.""ÿ The point of encouragement is to help each other with our sins.ÿ The point is to set our perspective straight, to clear away the cobwebs that come from sin. I think there can be no other way to work this out practically except to say that we are being honest with each other about our weaknesses, and then getting help from each other.ÿ We're airing things out and then getting another brother or sister's perspective on things so that we won't be hardened.ÿ And look!ÿ He says, ""Do it every day!"" I kind of doubt that very many people in our churches follow this guideline.ÿ I'm not trying to get negative about the relationships we have.ÿ I'm just trying to point out that we probably have a lot of work to do in this area. <h2>Honesty brings understanding</h2> This McGinnis guy, who wrote, <em>The Friendship Factor</em>, says that you never really understand yourself till you reveal yourself to someone else.ÿ I see this as true.ÿ There is something about having to explain ourselves to someone else that brings clarity.ÿ They want a logical presentation of random, often unconnected feelings.ÿ And this brings things together for us. They bring clarity to things that otherwise we would have decieved ourselves about. Here's the thing I want to say about honesty in our relationships.ÿ Is their anyone in your life, that when you don't disclose something, your conscience bothers you? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: <h2>Beyond our marriages</h2> I want to take the time on this point to talk about the issue of relationships outside of marriage.ÿ Because I think a lot of people feel that their close friendship is with their spouse, and then if they can be generally friendly with other folks, that's nice too. I want to disagree with this notion.ÿ First on the biblical grounds that our love should not be so limited. <h3>Luke 6:32</h3> Probably most of you have heard Lukeÿ6:32 applied to the idea that we ought to have love relationships outside our families.ÿ This is where Jesus says, ""What credit is it if you love them that love you?"" And I think there is an application here.ÿ Jesus is challenging us to go beyond that tight circle that we call ""my kind of people,"" whether it's our family or some other group. <h3>Love your neighbor</h3> But remember, the very command to love--what Jesus called one of the two greatest commandments--is directed not at our families, but at our neighbor.ÿ The command to love is directed <strong>out there</strong>. Biblically speaking, loving your family is another way of loving your own self. ÿYou are one.ÿ You spouses are one flesh. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Paul says in IÿTim.ÿ5:8 that ""if anyone does not provide for his own, especially his own household, he is worse than an unbeliever and has denied the faith!"" It is absolutely basic, fundamental that we love our family.ÿ Even the non-Christians at least try to do that.ÿ Christian love goes beyond our own selves, though.ÿ The love of Christ goes to those outside. <h3>Our relationships reflect our marriage</h3> But secondly, I want to object on the grounds that these marriage relationships that people say is their begin- and end-all, are not as healthy as we think they are.ÿ Often our marriages are where we get used to the rut of various sins.ÿ For the first couple years we fight about the sins of the other person that bother us.ÿ Then we start to accept them and figure out how to cope.ÿ But after many years, if people haven't divorced, they are often resigned to some very lazy and damaging relating styles. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: A wife will get used to a husband's lack of involvement to the point that she is amazed when he takes a whole day away from T.V. or work to spend with her and the kids.ÿ ""What's wrong honey?ÿ Have you been having an affair or something?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: A husband will get used to his wife's pushing and whining to the point that the frequency of her voice is one he doesn't even hear anymore.ÿ He can go right on reading, watching T.V. or whatever it is even though she's screaming at him in the background. The point is that we have a subtle feeling of closeness, but the truth is that we have just grown numb to things. And this goes for the more faithful, tribal relationships that we would often be tempted to call ""successful.""ÿ The infantile-difuse types of people just get divorced as soon as they can't take it anymore.ÿ Then they move on to the next love of their life. I am going to say that the quality of relationship you have outside your marriage is a gauge of how things are within the marriage. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Why is it that most American men, by the time they are 40, have absolutely no real friends outside their families?ÿ They may have budies that they pal around with.ÿ But they are at such a personal distance that it would be totally awkward to share, for example, how he has been feeling about himself lately.ÿ Are these friendless American males this way because they are so busy loving their families?ÿ NO!ÿ It's because they are the same way with their families!ÿ They are just as distant and coldÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And we could come up with examples for women, but I'm already accused of being sexist all the time so I think I'll keep my mouth shut and just pick on men. So, when you ask yourself, ""How are my love relationships?""ÿ Don't look at your marriage.ÿ We have too much of an ability to decieve ourselves their and just grow numb to our own sinfulness.ÿ Like I said, marriage can be the rut-builder for all our pet sins.ÿ Instead, look to the people who don't have to live with you.ÿ Look to the people who don't have to tolerate you.ÿ how are things with them? <h2>Practical steps towards honesty</h2> Now it's all to easy to say that we ought to be honest with each other.ÿ Everybody probably kind of knows this anyway.ÿ But when it comes down to it, I find that honesty is kind of hard to do. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here you are after a meeting with a few friends, and you say, ""Look, I've been having these lustful thoughts latelyÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ It's just as likely to be met with a joke as with a good ear.ÿ It's an awkward situation. This is why it is that we need to have the right setting for self-disclosure.ÿ You have to be intentional about this kind of thing.ÿ It won't do to have a regular time with someone and hope that you are honest with each other.ÿ You could just as easily spend your whole time talking about other people, or about sports or anything. So we need a setting for being honest about ourselves.ÿ I will say two things need to be there.ÿ First, the setting needs to be intimate.ÿ By intimate I mean a setting which is conducive to conversationÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Secondly, the setting needs to be long-term.ÿ I mean that honesty doesn't happen in one hour unless you are with a counselor.ÿ Then you feel, ""I'm going to get me $50 worth, so let's get down to it!""ÿ But with friends it's not that way.ÿ It takes a long time to come out with stuff.ÿ I mean a long time. That's why, if you are considering getting a relationship going with someone where you want honesty, consider taking a weekend together to go somewhereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Once one of these relationships is started, you still have to keep things going with long periods of time together. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you're like me, I don't even think about telling someone about myself until I've been with them a long time.ÿ This is because I have such a natural inclination away from honesty.ÿ There are tons of more interesting things to talk about before me.ÿ So I have to exhaust those first, then I'll get around to myself. Lot's of time.ÿ If you are face to face with someone for a long time, you eventually have to get down to some content. <h1>Affecting each other's feelings</h1> The second area I want to talk about is the area of affecting each other's feelings.ÿ Now, when you are in a relationship with someone this is how you touch that person in a relational way, through their feelings.ÿ It's amazing how simple this is, but a lot of us don't understand it or believe it at all. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I went for years as a Christian asking the simple question, ""Why do I have to have a feelings-encounter with someone in order to be their friend?""ÿ And the funny thing was how few people were able to answer my question! <h2>The Scriptures demand it</h2> Jesus said we are to love God with our emotions (Markÿ12:30).ÿ This is what the saying, ""Love God with all your heart"" means.ÿ The heart refers to turning your emotional engergy towards God.ÿ And one of the ways we are to do this is in worship, but also in our times of prayer with Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I Pet. 1:22 - I like I Peter 1:22 along these lines because Peter uses the same idiom for the way we ought to be with each other, except he really exaggerates it.ÿ In effect he says, ""wholeheartedly love each other from the heart.""ÿ He is saying, ""really pour it on.""ÿ And he is emphasizing that we show all the loving <strong>emotions</strong> we can. Beyond these passages there are those that tell us to be ""kind"" and warm to each other, which are the more positive types of emotion (2 Pet. 1:7; I Cor.ÿ13:4). And there is Paul's own example of emotional attachment to his co-workers like Timothy and Titus (2 Co. 2:13; IÿCor.ÿ4:17) <h2>Do you effect someone?</h2> Now, when I say that there has to be an emotional exchange between people, let me quantify it in this way:ÿ Is there anyone in your life who you consciously, intentionally, and even by way of declaration, intend to affect their emotions? What I mean is that there are obviously people who I have good talks with and warm times with.ÿ These are emotional exchanges.ÿ In fact, it is hard to have an encounter with someone without effecting their emotions.ÿ We do it automatically.ÿ So I am not talking about just having an emotional impact on someone. When you work on a deep, biblically loving relationship, you are consciously trying to sharpen your impact on that person.ÿ You are trying to make yourself better at it.ÿ What I'm talking about is someone who you say, ""I'm going to effect his emotions.ÿ And I'm going to let him effect mine."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This is the kind of thing you ought to declare somehow with someone.ÿ Because your intention needs to be clear.ÿ This is a way of being vulnerable and putting yourself on the line, to state up front that you intend to have a good effect on someone's emotions and you would very much like them to have an effect on yours. How can we do this?ÿ The way I have described it is somewhat clinical.ÿ But it boils down to some very simple, yet hard to say statements like, ""I feel good to be around you.ÿ I want to really work at this relationship."" ""You're one of the few people I really feel comfortable around.ÿ I consider our relationship to be kind of stabilizing and needed in my life."" These kinds of statements communicate that the other person has an effect on you, but also that you are commited to the relationship to make it work better.ÿ But this is just the beginning. You have to regularly sharpen your ability to have an emotional effect on someone.ÿ This is only done by communicating about how we effect each other.ÿ This is something that some married folks have learned--that you have to have regular dialogue about how you effect each other or else you will get calloused and numb to the sins of your marriage. So, you have to ask, ""How did I make you feel when I did this or that?"" Or the general question, ""How have you been feeling about me lately?"" The sad truth is, very few married couples do this, and even fewer single people do it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I was talking to my cell group about feelings, and I suggested that they might want to have this kind of conversation with someone, their mouths dropped to the floor.ÿ ""No way! (they thought I was being wildly exaggerated) You mean you would actually ask someone how you make them feel?!ÿ What a bizzare question!"" I just had to shake my head and wonder ""what have I been teaching these guys?"" <h2>How else do we know we are impacting someone personally?</h2> Think about it.ÿ How else do we know we are impacting someone personally? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I might be having an effect on the things someone knows.ÿ I might as well program a computer. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I might be having an effect on someone's behavior, I might as well be a trainer, or a Bible teacher, or a paid counselor. That's not a love relationship. But it is when I, as a person have an effect on you as a person that we start to talk about how we make each other <strong>feel</strong>.ÿ There is no such thing as personal impact and interaction apart from our feelings, whether we acknowledge it or not. So, if we are going to grow at love, then we have to consciously hone our ability to effect someone's feelings.ÿ We have to be vulnerable by stating our intention to do so.ÿ And we have to follow through with regular discussions about how we make each other feel. Now, how many people in your home church do this?",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04276.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Relationships - Buck McCallum",

"Unlocking Your Potential: Finding Out What You Have",1992-02-07,,"  <h1>My own story</h1> We're talking about how God wants to develop us and grow us.ÿ We're talking abuot how God sees our potential like no one else does.ÿ I thought that right up front I ought to tell you about myself.ÿ Because the way that most of you know me is through this medium--a teacher.ÿ And it is a completely inaccurate medium.ÿ Because here I am, all prepared and studied, giving you exactly what I planned to give. If only you knew the way I am from day to day.ÿ If only you knew what I have been in life.ÿ I could tell you some things.ÿ And it would probably make us all feel better about ourselves.ÿ But I would get too embarassed. I'm saying this because, without a doubt, none of the things that you think, ""Buck McCallum is good at this,"" would be true today if it weren't for God at work in my life.ÿ None of them. Before I let God start to change me, I had habbits with people that were destructive and alienating.ÿ I was very insecure.ÿ I was kind of weird. But God has been able to change me so much that I'm able to make an impact, not only in this way, but in other ways.ÿ And that makes me real happy.ÿ Because none of it would have been possible without God. So, when you talk to me, I know God is good.ÿ I know God loves me.ÿ When someone says, ""Why should I listen to God?"" the answer is automatic to me.ÿ ""Because he loves you.ÿ Because he wants the best for you."" ""Will God change me if I become a Christian?""ÿ Without hesitation, ""You bet he'll change you!""ÿ And when he does, you're going to look back and say, ""I can't believe it!ÿ Thank you God!"" And there will also be people who don't let God change them.ÿ And they'll be the same.ÿ And they'll regret it. So, there's my point of view.ÿ There's my experience.ÿ I know God loves us and my life is proof of that. <h1>God knows us best</h1> The first thing that I want to talk about in connection with our topic is the fact that God is all-knowing.ÿ It's more than a knowledge of how the universe runs, it's personal. <h2>Luke 12:6, 7</h2> Here's a passage that says something kind of startling.ÿ It is startling enough that it makes you wonder if it is just a figure of speachÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (anywhere from 80 to 120 thousand hairs!)ÿ You'd have to figure that hairs aren't the only thing that God is so knowledgable about.ÿ In fact, I think the point here is that if God knows about this most insignificant area, then he knows about everything. So, here is the thesis: There is no one in the whole universe who knows you as well as God does. <h2>We think we do</h2> Now, some of us are sitting here and saying, ""I know, I know, God knows everthing.ÿ That's a basic about God.ÿ Blah, blah, blah."" Don't assume that you know this, and especially don't assume that you believe it.ÿ This issue is the major bone of contention between ourselves and God.ÿ We think that we know ourselves, and nobody knows us better than we know ourselves, including God. If we really believed that God knew us better than we know ourselves, think of it.ÿ We would look at everything we do and realize, ""God has a better way than mine."" We would look at the ways that we use to feel good and say, ""I'm sure that God's way is better."" ÿHowever I feel good, eating food, drinking, drugs, money, whatever.ÿ We would say, ""I'm sure that my way is vastly inferior!ÿ I'm settling for matchbox cars when I could be driving the real thing."" We would look at God's view of money, possessions and career and say, ""OK, that's what I want too,"" even though what he says may fly in the face of every commercial, every opinion, etc. that you have ever heard. We would look at God's view of sexuality and say, ""I'm sure his way is better!ÿ He designed it.ÿ I'm sure he understands how it should be used better than I do!"" Is that what I hear when I talk to people about their sexuality?ÿ Hardly!ÿ I hear anger!ÿ ""That's the one thing about Christianity that I'm not going to tolerate!""ÿ It's amazing.ÿ But these same people believe that God exists.ÿ They believe he is the infinite God who knows all things.ÿ It doesn't make a lot of sense. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember when I was in 8th grade, I rode a motorcycle once.ÿ Just once!ÿ But that didn't matter, because now I was an expert on motorcycles.ÿ I went around blabbling about how to pop a wheely and how to bang through the geers and on and on.ÿ It was embarassing! But that's the way we are about so many things.ÿ We have had some experience with sex.ÿ Or we've had some experience with romance.ÿ Or we've had some experience with whatever and we've read some things.ÿ And then we're going to turn to the God of the universe and say, ""I know better!""ÿ Even if you've had 10 years of experience with sex!ÿ Even if you've had 20 years experience at trying to feel good!ÿ We're going to turn to the God of the universe, who actually created human beings and say, ""I'm fine, I think I understand more than you?""ÿ It's an embarassing picture when you really think about it. And yet, that's what we all do.ÿ About different areas of our life, we think we know better than God.ÿ And it shows by our actions. So don't assume that you believe God knows you better than you know yourself.ÿ This is a very hotly contested and disbelieved proposition. This kind of leads into our next point.ÿ But I think the first step for all of us is to see that we don't believe God knows us best.ÿ To see that we really believe that we know ourselves best, and our actions show that. <h1>Steps to finding what God sees in me</h1> I want to talk along a positive vein about finding out what God sees inside of you.ÿ If he does know me better than I know myself, then what does he know?ÿ Will he tell me what he knows?ÿ And the answer is that he knows a lot.ÿ He knows things about you that would really surprise you.ÿ And yes, he does want to share that knowledge with you. So, now we're going to talk about how that can happen. <h2>Faith</h2> Faith is the Bible's term for a decision you make.ÿ You decide whether you are going to believe what God says.ÿ This is something that God requires.ÿ He requires that we decide.ÿ ""Are you going to believe me or not?""ÿ He has a lot of things to say, but he's not going to waste his breath on someone who doesn't even want to hear what he has to say. This makes a lot of sense.ÿ Because of God gives us his insight before we're ready to hear it, we'll trash it.ÿ We'll lampoon it in our minds.ÿ We'll tear it up and throw it away. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember I was in conflict with someone and I went to get some advice.ÿ It was from my wife.ÿ She told me what I ought to do, and she was right.ÿ Mistake was, though, I wasn't ready to hear it.ÿ I didn't want to hear what was right.ÿ I wanted to hear someone who agreed with me.ÿ And the sad thing is that I then made her pay the price, as I attacked her and her stupid views.ÿ I found every reason I could to discard what she said. Well, Jesus talked about this type of thing in Matthewÿ7, when he said, ""Don't give pearls to pigs, cause if it's not food, they'll just stomp on them and grind them into the mud."" I hate to see it about myself, but a lot of times I'm a pig.ÿ I have no regard for what's precious. But God waits until we're ready.ÿ A lot of people get the feeling that God never talks to me.ÿ ""It seems like I never get any insight about myself, or what God wants me to do.ÿ Is there something wrong with me?ÿ Am I really a Christian?"" Here is a place to start.ÿ Do you really want to hear?ÿ Are you at the point with God where you can come and say, ""God, I want to hear your perspective, I want to hear your point of view, and I don't care what it is.ÿ Because I know that you know better than me.""ÿ That is faith. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There are some powerful stories of faith in the Bible.ÿ But one that always amazes me is the story of Abraham, when he first started following God.ÿ The Bible tells us that God came to Abraham and said, ""Abraham, I have something great for you!ÿ I want to give you a key role in my plan to save the world.""ÿ But then God said that he wanted Abraham to leave his home and family, and move to another place.ÿ Then Abraham said, ""Where?""ÿ And God said, ""I'll show you when you get there!"" Hebrews 11:8 says,ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So there's faith.ÿ You have to consider if you're ready to put your faith in God.ÿ Do you really believe that he's God?ÿ Do you really believe that he knows you better than you know yourself?ÿ Are you ready to trust him, no matter what he might show you? <h2>A willingness to leave behindÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> There is one facet of this decision which is implied, but I don't want to take anything for granted.ÿ If you are going to come to God in faith, and say, ""God I believe you know me better than I know myself.ÿ Show me what you have for me.ÿ And whatever it is, I want it.""ÿ Then that implies that you have to be willing to leave behind something.ÿ You have to be wiling to leave behind the picture of yourself that you've created over the years. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Abraham, when he was called to go to another land, had to leave behind the place he was.ÿ It was one in the same. And that's the way it often is with us.ÿ I'm not saying that God is going to take everything from you.ÿ What I am saying is that if he points to something and says, ""I've got something better,"" then there has to be a resolve on our part to let it go.ÿ And it can be quite painful.ÿ Because you're letting go of something that you may have trusted for years. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let me get real practical about what I mean.ÿ I for a long time have conceived of myself as a person who is very independant, and doesn't really care what anyone thinks.ÿ I can remember being embarassed once in the first grade, when me and Bradly Palmer had captured a couple milk cartons and replaced the contents with urine.ÿ We were in the process of putting them back where they could be purchased when we were caught.ÿ For this, we received a paddling in front of the entire class (actually, it was the kind of thing where the principle would come with the paddle in hand and call you out into the hall, then the whole class would listenÿ.ÿ.ÿ.).ÿ When I came back into the class all red-faced and embarassed, I looked at the kids and thought, ""It doesn't matter, cause I'm going to blow this school up anyway!"" That, and other experiences developed in me a picture of someone who doesn't care what anyone thinks.ÿ And God began to put a finger on that area of my life, ""I want you to be the kind of person who is real sensitive to what people think.""ÿ That posed a real dilemma.ÿ Was I willing to give up something that had been a source of strength for me all those years? So, this is tough.ÿ I know it's tough because God and I have argued about different issues like this for some time.ÿ But it all comes down to this: Is it really true that God knows more about us than we know about ourselves?ÿ Is it really true that he loves us? If the answer to those questions is yes, then there is absolutely no debateÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I want you to think about where you stand on thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>The context: people</h2> I want to end on this note: When people talk about developing themselves, it is almost always some kind of a self-centered quest to find my potential.ÿ ""How great can I be?"" There is a great secret here that we are going to explore in the next several weeks.ÿ And that is that God designed our abilities and strengths to come to light in a certain atmosphere.ÿ They will bloom only under the right conditions. This is what we're going to be talking about over the next couple weeksÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04350.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Unlocking Your Potential - Buck McCallum",

"Unlocking Your Personality",1992-02-21,," <h1>What is personality?</h1> We could start off with the question tonight of what is personality?ÿ The topic of this teaching is that God develops our personality.ÿ But what is it? Is it something you are born with? Is it something that you can change? There are a lot of interesting issues like that.ÿ But what we're going to do tonight is define personality as the total picture of you that makes you unique.ÿ Parts of you may be found in others, like your intelligence or your warmth.ÿ But it is very unlikely that anyone has the whole package that you have.ÿ And that is what we'll call ""your personality."" I'm sure that much of it was given to us genetically.ÿ And I'm also sure that we were shaped massively by our experience in life. But whatever the case, I want to return to a thesis that we have made a big deal out of here.ÿ And that is, God knows you better than you know yourself.ÿ He knows what experiences have shaped you. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We talk about the ""sub-conscious.""ÿ Well, what that means is that something has shaped us but we're not that aware of it anymore.ÿ But God hasn't forgotten.ÿ He never forgets anything. God also knows what we were born with.ÿ He knows our potential.ÿ He knows what we haven't even discovered yet.ÿ One of the strongest passages on this is Psa.ÿ139:13ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Again, I emphasize that this is consistent with the Bible's point of view that God is involved, even in everyday events like the birth of a new person.ÿ We make this sharp distinction between the natural and the supernatural.ÿ God is only in those things that we don't understand.ÿ But God's point of view is, ""Hey, I also made all those things you do understand.ÿ I'm involved all around you.""ÿ Even though some of the things God does we have been able to decipher and label with scientific terms--that doesn't mean he is not involved. And so God tells us that he is involved in our makeup--what eventually becomes our personality. <h1>Our facades are for others</h1> But then, what happens is life is that we start to take charge.ÿ We start to ask ourselves, ""Who do I want to be?"" You know what the saddest part of it is?ÿ When we answer this question, we look out and ask, ""What do others want me to be?""ÿ We don't look in and say, ""What's really there?""ÿ In large part, that's because we don't know, especially when we're really young.ÿ God knows.ÿ But what we do know is what others want out of us.ÿ So, we start to behave accordingly. I remember I used to stand at the doors to my high school every morning and afternoon and just watch people.ÿ It was hard to find better entertainment.ÿ And the reason it was so entertaining was that everyone had a gimmick.ÿ Everyone had a face.ÿ And they worked on that face to put it out there so everyone could see it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If they were jocks, or considered themselves hard-asses, then they would walk with arms extended out slightly from the side of their body.ÿ Now the reason some hard-asses on TV do that is because their lateral muscles are so huge that their arms don't quite drop to their sides.ÿ I suppose another reason might be that gunslingers in the Westerns wanted to keep ready at all times.ÿ But here these scrawny teenagers would be walking around with their arms out!ÿ Why?ÿ Because they were putting their face out there to people!ÿ They had an image <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Then there were people who were popular.ÿ These people had to appear like they were constantly doing something very important--like they were wanted .ÿ It was uncool for them to be alone.ÿ But if they were alone, then they had to look busy.ÿ They had to look like they were looking for someone?someone just up ahead at the lockers. I don't want to pretend that I didn't have my gimmicks, because I did.ÿ I just used to get such a kick out of watching other people's though. We become who other people think we ought to be. Do you think this gets better as a person gets older?ÿ No way.ÿ If anything it gets more fierce.ÿ Because the judgments we pass on one another become more and more final.ÿ When you're still growing up, then you can be awkward or you can be finding your way.ÿ But you get to a certain age and that's no excuse anymore.ÿ You become a loser in life. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You become an ingnorant person. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You become a brilliant, upwardly mobile go-getter. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You become a lazy slob. There are tons of slots that we put people in, and it gets more permanent and more damning the older you get. But in all this, where is God?ÿ Where is the one who knows what we're really like?ÿ Where's the one who knows what we really could be?ÿ He's usually completely out of the picture.ÿ And yet it's clear that God really gets off on the differences between us.ÿ He sees them and he wants to take advantage of them. <h1>God appreciates our uniqueness</h1> There is a story in Johnÿ1 that is so telling of the way God sees us and appreciates us.ÿ The book of John is the story of God coming to earth to live among us in the person of Jesus Christ.ÿ And John starts his book this way.ÿ It's very high-flying, with all kinds of powerful languageÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.ÿ In him was life, and that life was the light of men.ÿ (Johnÿ1:3, 4) The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.ÿ He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.ÿ (Johnÿ1:9, 10) So God is coming into the world.ÿ But then in the second half of the chapter you start to meet the person, Jesus.ÿ And he's just walking along, being a regular guy.ÿ The first two guys he meets ask him, ""Where are you staying tonight?""ÿ He says, ""Come on, check it out.""ÿ So they start travelling together. Then they meet this guy named Simon.ÿ And Jesus gives him a nickname, Peter, which means ""the rock.""ÿ So here is God, the light of the world, the beginning and the end, the creator of all things, and he's walking around giving people nicknames. Then he meets this guy named Nathaniel.ÿ The encounter between Nathaniel and Jesus is so typical of the way God appreciates people and their personalities. We meet Nathanael in v.ÿ45, when his friend Philip comes to get him and tell him about Jesus.ÿ Basically, he says, ""The messiah is here!ÿ The one who has been promised to us throughout the whole Old Testament!"" Then you kind of get a feel for the type of person Nathanael is by his answer.ÿ It's like, ""Yeah, right!ÿ Some hillbilly from Nazareth is going to be the messiah!""ÿ This is the kind of guy that has no problem throwing cold water on your fire if he feels like it. Anyway, he agrees to go see this Jesus guy.ÿ And Jesus sees him coming.ÿ And in v.ÿ47, Jesus says, ""Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.""ÿ What he means is, ""Here's a guy who shoots straight!ÿ He says what he thinks!"" Now, Nathanael knows that he's this way.ÿ So he says to Jesus, ""How did you know me?ÿ Did someone tell you about me already?"" And Jesus gives him some more, ""Before Philip even found you, I saw you sitting under the tree.""ÿ In other words, ""I knew who you are and where you were before you even heard of me.""ÿ Of course, this is God speaking.ÿ This is the guy who sees you when you're sitting on the toilet.ÿ He sees you when you're all alone. This obviously impresses Nathanael, because he respondsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But what is the net effect of this interaction?ÿ The net effect is that Nathanael sees, ""Here is someone who knows me.ÿ He appreciates the way I am.ÿ Here's someone who has supernatural insight about me.""ÿ And he decides to follow Jesus Christ. This is what I want you to see about God.ÿ He looks at us and sees our uniqueness.ÿ And he really likes it. <h1>We owe a debt to others</h1> But here we come to a difference in perspective about our uniqueness.ÿ We view our personality as a tool to use to advance our cause.ÿ It's a way to get people to like us.ÿ It's a tool we use to make money.ÿ It's a tool we use to get our way. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Our looks are part of how we project our personality.ÿ And who doesn't use their looks to advance their cause?ÿ That's why it is so interesting to watch people.ÿ You can just look at how they look and ask yourself, ""What is he after?ÿ What's she trying to get?""ÿ It's one of the more obvious things about us. But the way we use our looks is just typical of how we use our personality.ÿ We use our personality to attract people, or to get ahead, or to make a way for us.ÿ It's very different from the way that God looks at us. When God sees our uniqueness, he sees an obligation.ÿ He sees a debt.ÿ We see a tool to use for ourselves.ÿ God sees a debt that we owe. <h2>Scriptures</h2> Paul looked at his life this way.ÿ In IÿCorinthiansÿ4, he describes himself this way, So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.ÿ Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.ÿ I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.ÿ My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who examines me. He is saying that whatever he has was given him by God.ÿ That is why other people's evaluations of him don't matter.ÿ ""God gave me what I have, I have to answer to him.""ÿ Do you see the sense of indebtedness Paul has here?ÿ He calls what he has been given by God a ""trust."" In fact, a couple verses later he turns around and points his fingers at his audience when he asks a very powerful question: What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not? Do you see the perspective here?ÿ Everything you have is a gift from God.ÿ We are indebted to our creator. <h2>Gospel</h2> Before we go any further with this, I want to say that this is where we need to start with God.ÿ This is how we turn to God and become a Christian.ÿ We turn to him in prayer and admit, ""God, you are my God.ÿ You are the one who gave me everything.ÿ And I want your forgiveness for living my own life apart from you."" That is how we get started with God.ÿ As I go on here and talk about how to really draw out your personality, it won't matter if you haven't made the first step of coming to God and asking him for his forgiveness, and for a relationship with him. Like I said, that is what it means to become a Christian. <h2>Pay the debt to others</h2> But now what's really interesting, is that the way God wants us to use our trust--our stewardship--is to serve others.ÿ He wants us to take what he gave us, and give it to others. When God gives us our abilities, when he gives us our life, he gives it to us so that we can give it away.ÿ Look how strong Paul says it in Romansÿ13, Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled God's law. We owe.ÿ God gave us all that we have so that we could give it away.ÿ We owe a debt to others. In fact, a passage that is kind of unsettling (at least it should be for most of us here), is where Jesus talks about the principle that when you are given a lot, you owe a lot.ÿ In Luke 12:48, he talks about a principle that I believe applies to many situations and many issues. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. When we see a person with a lot, we say, ""There's a person who can really get ahead in life.""ÿ But when God sees a person whom he has given a lot to, he says, ""There's a person who is deeply indebted.ÿ That person is going to have to give a lot."" I look out here, and I see some serious debts that people owe.ÿ Because I know that God has given you a lot. But at the same time, I know the way we naturally think.ÿ ""What am I going to do with my smarts?ÿ Am I going to get this degree or that one?""ÿ ""What am I going to do with my good looks?ÿ Am I going to catch one excellent babe?ÿ Or am I going to hunt for hundreds of them?"" This is how we look at what we have. <h2>Key to being ourselves</h2> This is too bad.ÿ Because, in looking at our uniqueness this way, we will actually supress or even ruin what God has given us. Remember I said that God wants to draw out our uniqueness.ÿ But that we only really develop in the right circumstances?ÿ We only really develop in the right atmosphere? Well here it is.ÿ Here is a key, a major secret, to really being who God meant you to be: it's to find out how you can serve and make a difference to others. This is it.ÿ God wants to draw out your uniqueness in the context of you trying to serve others. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I told you about the example of Peter.ÿ Jesus gave him the nickname of the ""Rock,"" and the reason, he tells Peter in Matthewÿ16, is that he's going to use Peter to be someone that people depend on.ÿ He's going to make Peter into the kind of person that people will lean on. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Today there are some unique features to my personality that I see.ÿ One of them is the ability to get people intersted in something.ÿ Essentially, there are elements of a salesman there.ÿ But that part of my personality only really became evident when I turned my life over to God and said, ""God, how can I make a difference in people's lives?""ÿ And God began to give me opportunities to interest people in him. I know that there are some people out there who consider themselves ""dull people.""ÿ ""I don't have very much of a personality.""ÿ God doesn't agree at all. I don't know how many times I'm going to see this happen, but it always amazes me.ÿ We'll see two people come to God, one an apparently dynamic personality because they have sharpened their come-off over the years.ÿ The other, an apparently borish person who doesn't seem to have much.ÿ But the second person really wants to serve God and really wants to have God use him in other people's lives.ÿ In time--2, 3, 4, 5 years down the road--that second person is much more dynamic, much more interesting, you can tell has much more to offer. Why is this?ÿ Because that second person got in the right environment to have his personality shaped by God. On the other hand, when you live to please other people, or even if you live to please yourself, you'll only tap a little bit of what's there.ÿ Because God's not into that.ÿ He's not into helping you help yourself.ÿ He's not into helping you become what others want you to be.ÿ He's into helping you be who you really are, by finding ways you can serve others. Can I get practical here?ÿ I can't go around the room and say, ""You ought to serve people this wayÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ But I can tell you something that is very practical.ÿ Talk to a Christian you know and respect--someone who you have seen God change.ÿ Talk to that person about ways that you can be used by God in other people's lives. That is where you are going to get some of the best, most practical wisdom. <h1>The purpose of this meeting</h1> I want to take a few minutes here at the end to talk about something a little different, the purpose of this meeting.ÿ We are trying to have a whole night here where we present God's answers on different topics.ÿ We see this as real valuable and applicable for both Christians and those who are considering Christianity. I've been approached by a number of you and told that these topics are real applicable.ÿ Well, that's because they are applicable to me too. But it's not just the teaching.ÿ We try to round up music, skits, videos and anything else we can to creatively communicate the message.ÿ What I've been growing more concerned about is that I think that there has been a tendency to not view the opening music as part of the meeting.ÿ I think that there is a tendency to view it as an optional opening if you want to come early. This is seen by the fact that most--most--people come late.ÿ And also most people talk extensively durring the music. Now look, I don't want to get heavy with anyone here.ÿ I want to be able to talk durring the music.ÿ I like to talk.ÿ I want a laid-back scene.ÿ But I think that we have gone too far on this.ÿ I see us getting worse.ÿ And I think this really hurts the meeting in a couple ways. First, we are working on making the musical part of this meeting an integral part of the whole message.ÿ We have some secular tunes with no particular message--just good music. But we also have some tunes that are designed to carry a message.ÿ We are really emphasizing variety.ÿ We want to get lots of different types of music with different types of messages up here.ÿ And we have asked the muscicians to talk a little bit about the songs that they are doing. So, the music is a big part of what we're trying to do with this meeting.ÿ And, frankly, at times I have felt for the musicians up here when it appears that not that many people are listening to them.ÿ They work as hard as I do or more.ÿ They are trying to serve God and serve you.ÿ And I think, ""What if I got up to speak and most of the people weren't even here?ÿ Or they weren't listening, walking around talking at the back?""ÿ I might feel pretty bad. But secondly, the music is intended to get the group started and focused.ÿ People take a certain amount of time to get settled and focused.ÿ We are trying to use the music to this end.ÿ What is happening, though, is that with people coming late, etc., the meeting is not really getting settled down and focused until the teaching starts. This, I believe, hurts the message for the evening.ÿ Some of those first few minutes are very key, and yet I can tell as a teacher that I'm struggling to get people's attention. So, I know that some of you guys who have been coming around here a long time feel like you can afford to come late or jabber around at the beginning.ÿ I'm just saying, think about it.ÿ If you really have something to say durring the music, then go ahead.ÿ Talk.ÿ We don't want to take that away.ÿ But if you're just socializing, then why not come extra early, or wait until afterwards?",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04352.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Unlocking Your Potential - Buck McCallum",

"Marriage: Roles of Men and Women in Marriage",1992-04-24,," Differences are Good <h1>Review last week</h1> I think the important thing to remember about men is that they are intended to initiate--to be the first one to make a move (recall scripture).ÿ By that I don't mean that the man is intended to initiate the first date or something stupid like that.ÿ What I mean is that men are happiest when they are initiating personal contact with another human.ÿ Adam was lonely so God gave him another human to reach out to. But a man is happiest when he is reaching out to another human, male or female, and saying, ""I need you.ÿ Let's talk.ÿ Let's relate.""ÿ That's the kind of initiation we're talking about here. And we also looked at the fact that what we see is almost just the opposite.ÿ We see men running away from human contactÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Cindy talks about womenÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>We need each other (Gen. 1; I Cor. 12)</h1> <h2>Buck describes Gen. 1:26, 27</h2> How does it say here that God created humankind? First it says that he created man in the image of God. Now, what else does it say about humans?ÿ Male and female. Image of Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. male and female.ÿ The image of God is male and female. Here's the point: If a human is going to be what God originally intended, you can't ignore the other half.ÿ The other half of God's image--whatever it is that God wants us to be--is embodied in the opposite sex! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It would be like a puzzle where half the pieces are held by someone else.ÿ You're going to face a lot frustration if you try to do the puzzle by yourself. Now I'm not saying that you have to get married to be complete.ÿ What I'm saying is that you can't ignore the opposite sex.ÿ All the barriers we have errected, they have to go. Cindy says, ""Paul takes this and elaborates in IÿCor.ÿ12ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Concludes with: There's a problem we run up against. <h1>Problem: We only have two styles of relating</h1> <h2>Describe the problem with examples</h2> The problem is that when it comes to the opposite sex, we only have two ways that we relate--either romance (which includes the hunt), or not at all. Starting at about your guys' age, the opposite sex starts to have only one purpose, someone to have a romance with.ÿ That's all they are.ÿ They're no longer just humans.ÿ They are ""the people I have to score with."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's just say that ______ and _____ were over here in the corner talking afterwards for a half hour.ÿ Hey, you guys got something going?ÿ ""No, we were just talking.""ÿ ""Yeah!ÿ Right!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember being caught totally off guard once in front of a bunch of people.ÿ It was in ninth grade, and this girl wanting something from me, I think it was a cigarette.ÿ I was liking this girl and wanting to get a thing with her. So, naturally, I didn't give her a cigarette.ÿ I was toying with her.ÿ She asked, ""Don't you like me Buck?""ÿ There were all these people around, and I was like, ""Well, uhÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ And she said, ""No, not in that way!ÿ I mean, don't you like me as a person?"" Cindy needs to throw in an example here. So, the ideal we are trying to get accross here is just talking.ÿ Communicate with people from the opposite sex like they're humans. <h2>Because it's freeing and fun, there's a lot to learn</h2> Cindy on: They wish that they could relate normally.ÿ All the peer pressure and expecations are ruining that desire. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember when I came around this fellowship, the only people my age were a couple of girls.ÿ So, I was kind of forced to learn how to make normal friends with women.ÿ It was great.ÿ We would hang out and talk.ÿ I learned something that I didn't really understand before: you could talk to a person for a couple hours straight!ÿ Just talk!ÿ I found that you could sit there, on a Saturday afternoon, and instead of saying, ""Lets' goÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ You could talk about one thing after another.ÿ And it was fun! <h1>Choose someone you would like to get to know, but not necessarily date.</h1> Cindy continues Concludes with: <h1>Practical steps to finding a middle ground (normal relating)</h1> Let me just leave you with a couple practicals that will be good for our exercise. <h2>Where do you start?</h2> Obviously, asking questions.ÿ But what are you looking for in your questions?ÿ What kind of questions? Find something in common. This is for the bold.ÿ But most of all, it's not for the prideful--people who are going around protecting their little egos. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You talk about ""stuck up people""?ÿ You think to yourself, ""She's stuck up, because she's so full of herself.""ÿ The fact is, the person who is stuck up is so scared, their ego is so fragile, that they're afraid to take risks. It comes down to a very simple question: What matters?ÿ What other people think about me?ÿ Or what God thinks about me?ÿ And what I have to offer other people. <h2>Show interest</h2> The second thing I can suggest is that you make someone feel like you are interested in them.ÿ How do you do that? Facial expressions, more questions, etc. The physical contact can help here too. Everyone wants to be interesting. Those two things I think are good for starters. <h1>Exercise for afterwards:</h1> We could get them to spend 5 minutes talking to someone of the opposite sex right there.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04423.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Marriage &amp; Dating - Buck McCallum",

"Christian Life: Prayer",1993-01-08,," Prayer <h1>Intro</h1> This is a series about the outward forms of Christianity, the things everyone sees.ÿ When you think of Christianity, you think of things like prayer, people who read the Bible, go to church, etc.ÿ So we're going to talk about those things and what they really mean.ÿ I think this is a series that is really good for people who have been to church before but may not understandÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I'm really glad we're talking about this right now, because it is something I have needed some serious help with.ÿ I feel like studying for this has been good for me. <h1>Matthew 6: The Lord's Prayer</h1> And if there has been any particular prayer that has been the prototype Christian prayer, it is the Lord's prayer.ÿ ""Our Fatherÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" So, I wanted to take that prayer tonight and talk about the real meaning of prayer.ÿ Because Jesus taught his disciples that prayer as an example of how to pray.ÿ There is a lot of insight there. <h2>The context</h2> First the context of the prayer.ÿ Matthew includes a few introductory words that Jesus had to say about the topic of prayer itself. <h2>Prayer is not for show (vv. 5, 6)</h2> This doesn't mean that you don't pray in public.ÿ In fact, at other times Jesus is very specific that we should pray in public.ÿ What he is objecing to is praying for the attention of others.ÿ Where you are consciously praying for the others to notice you. I can't think of anything more obvious.ÿ Prayer to God shouldn't be some kind of ego-inflating thing that you do for show.ÿ And yet, I have gotten the impression before that prayers are for show, to draw attention to the person. <h2>Not meaningless repetition (vv. 7, 8)</h2> The second introductory comment he makes is that prayer shouldn't be meaningless repetition.ÿ When you think about what prayer really is, it's kind of obvious.ÿ Prayer is talking to a person, God.ÿ God is just like you and me in the sense that he is a person.ÿ He's not a slot machine.ÿ He's not a tape recorder.ÿ He's a person. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Think of talking to a friend the way a lot of people pray.ÿ ""Thank you Bob.ÿ Just thank you Bob.ÿ Oh, Bob!ÿ Thank you, thank you, thank you!ÿ Bob, could I borrow a dollar?ÿ Yes, a dollar.ÿ Could I borrow a dollar, please?"" It would be totally ridiculous!ÿ But somehow we don't think this way about God.ÿ People talk to God and say the same thing over and over again.ÿ I'm not sure why.ÿ Maybe they don't think he hears them.ÿ It has to be.ÿ And of course that's a real reflection on your view of God.ÿ It says either that he's kind of deaf and you have to shout.ÿ Or, maybe he just doesn't care, and he'll only listen if you say it a hundred times. Whatever the reason, it's not a very attractive picture of God.ÿ And it's a picture that Jesus refutes. <h1>The Lord's prayer</h1> Then Jesus goes on and begins to teach them how they ought to pray, and he gives the example which has become so familiar to usÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Isn't it ironic that in the previous verse he says, ""Don't pray with meaningless repetition?""ÿ Is there any prayer that is repeated more meaninglessly than this one?ÿ I realize that it could be said with meaning, if you knew what ""hallowed"" means.ÿ Or if you knew what ""thy kingdom come"" means. What I want to do is look at each part of it and understand what it is that Jesus is teaching us about prayer. <h2>Our father in heaven</h2> First of all, ""our father in heaven,"" is a powerful statement, and most people miss the impact of it.ÿ But realize this: no one before Christ called God, ""Our Father.""ÿ People may have called him ""the great father,"" or ""God,"" or something like that.ÿ But no one dared call God ""my father"".ÿ It's presumptuous.ÿ It's a term of intimacy.ÿ It's a term that says you are on the inside. Actually, until Jesus Christ, it would have been completely presumptuous to say something like this.ÿ Because there was a very serious rift between humans and God.ÿ God was distant.ÿ God was estranged from us and stood in judgment over us.ÿ But it was Jesus Christ, who's death for us appease God's justice, and allowed God to say, ""OK, I accept these humans on an intimate and personal basis."" In other words, before Jesus Christ and his death for us, to approach God meant death.ÿ Because of our sinfulness.ÿ And yet after the death of Christ, he comes and live inside of us.ÿ And the Bible describes our relationship with God this way, Let us draw near with confidenceÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is a confidence that is absolutely essential to prayer.ÿ If you don't have this confidence, then prayer is just whistling in the dark, hoping someone hears you.ÿ But the Bible tells us that you can know for sure that God loves you, that God lives inside you, that God hears you.ÿ You can know this as a fact, if you take the step of faith to ask for God's forgiveness and ask him to come into you life.ÿ If you take that step in prayer, you can say with confidence, ""My father."" But then he says, ""who is in heaven.""ÿ And the idea here is not that God is in some special place called heaven.ÿ The idea is that God is unseen.ÿ God is supernatural.ÿ He exists in a realm that is beyond the merely physical.ÿ This is a statement of faith.ÿ It's to say, ""I know you're real.ÿ I know you hear me, even though I can't see you."" <h2>""Hallowed be your name""</h2> Then, the worst phrase in the whole thing, ""Hallowed be thy name.""ÿ I had so many weird images of this as a kid.ÿ But the main connection was to a halo.ÿ I thought of God's name with a halo around it. Basically to be ""hallowed,"" is for people to know the way you really are.ÿ Jesus is saying, ""God, what I want is for people to know the way you really are.""ÿ Since this prayer is teaching us how to pray, I think the desire here is that we should pray to understand God the way he really is.ÿ And we should pray that others see him the way he really is. This is really interesting.ÿ I could talk about this phrase right here the rest of the night.ÿ Because it says several things.ÿ For one it says that prayer should begin by reflecting on who God really is.ÿ And prayer should begin with a desire to see the truth about God come out. There's no doubt that no one in the history of the world has had his reputation as smeared, as mis-represented, as misunderstood as God.ÿ No one else even comes close.ÿ Because every thing gets attributed to God.ÿ Good things, bad things, things that we do, things that other people, things we were born withÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ Everything gets attributed to him, when it's convenient. The result has been that God's reputation is sinister.ÿ It's ominous.ÿ I know this is true because there is not a person I talk to about becoming a Christian who isn't at least a little apprehensive, ""What is God going to do to me?""ÿ ""I'm not sure I can follow God's ways.""ÿ ""I don't want to get carried away about God."" All of these concerns are related to God's reputation.ÿ And they are understandable concerns, given all the strange things that happen in the name of God. But, if the truth were known about God, if the real truth were known, we would throw ourselves upon him without reserve.ÿ And that's why Jesus says the first order of business in prayer is to get it straight who you're talking to.ÿ ""God, I want the truth about you.ÿ I want to know it.ÿ I want others to know it."" I think beginning our prayers this way is important from the standpoint of humility also.ÿ In other words, we're dealing with God.ÿ We're not dealing with a butler, or someone selling us a hamburger.ÿ Yes, there is an intimacy that God wants to have with us.ÿ But there is also a degree of respect and awe that is totally appropriate. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some people come to God on their knees.ÿ And I see nothing bad about that.ÿ In fact, I think it may be a good thing. I think this attitude is refected in the next statement. <h2>""Your kingdom come, your will be doneÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""</h2> What Christ is teaching us here is that we ought to tell God that we want his way.ÿ ""God, I want you to have your way."" Isn't this fascinating?ÿ ""God, I want you to have your way.""ÿ As if, we need to give him our permission or something!ÿ As funny as it sounds, that is kind of the idea here. God has authority, and he has power.ÿ But for the most part, God does not exercise that power on earth unless we want him to!ÿ In other words, God has volunatarily restricted himself on this earth.ÿ He will exercise his authority only when we want him to. So you can see that this part of the prayer is a statement of humility.ÿ It says, ""God, I want you to have your way.ÿ Whether it's my way or not, I want you to have your way.ÿ I want you to rule."" Dealing with God is like this.ÿ I don't think it's like this with anyone else.ÿ To say anything else is to say, ""No, I don't want you to rule.ÿ I don't want you to be God here on earth.""ÿ To say, ""God, I think I want you to have your way, what is it?"" is to say, ""I want to have my way.ÿ But I'll consider your way if you submit your plans."" Because God is God, because of his nature as an absolute authority, we have to decide if we want to let him rule.ÿ Yes or no.ÿ Not, ""I want you around, but could you just sit over there and be quiet?""ÿ Not, ""I want you just to help me with this problem here and that's all.""ÿ He's not a picture you put on the wall.ÿ He's not an ornament you wear around your neck.ÿ He's God.ÿ And we have to decide if we're going to relate to him as God or not. So these statements are teaching us about our attitude in prayer.ÿ It's an unusual combination of intimacy, on the one hand, but tremendous respect and humility on the other hand.ÿ Then he goes into the things that you should pray for yourself. <h2>Give us our daily bread</h2> First he says, ""Give us our daily bread.""ÿ Again, this is a paradigm.ÿ This is an example.ÿ He's not saying that every day you should pray for bread.ÿ The idea here is that we should pray to God for our needs.ÿ Our physical needs, our daily needs.ÿ These are the things that we need regularly. Again, this is so insightful.ÿ It teaches us what God wants to be for us.ÿ Because when it comes to daily needs, these are the things that we've gotten used to taking care of.ÿ These are the things that we think are ""our business.""ÿ They're not spiritual.ÿ They're small.ÿ God would have no interest in these issues. Yet here Jesus is saying that God does care.ÿ God wants us to learn to rely on him for these daily things we take for granted. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I'll just give you an example from my life.ÿ I sometimes pray to God for energy, for vigor throughout the day.ÿ And there is a difference between those days that I just stick my nose to the grind and go, versus those days that I turn to God for energy. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I used to pray to God about school, especially when things would get hard. But I have people all the time thinking that God doesn't want to hear about those kinds of requests.ÿ That's wrong!ÿ He does.ÿ In fact, he wants to hear more of them from us.ÿ Because what it shows is a greater degree of dependance on him.ÿ And God wants this kind of daily intimacy with us.ÿ He doesn't want to be the God who just takes care of problems we can't fix.ÿ He wants to be involved in our lives every single day. <h2>Forgive our sinsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> The second thing we are to pray for ourselves is, ""Forgive our sins as we forgive.""ÿ This is a potentially confusing saying.ÿ Because it can be construed a couple different ways that would be inaccurate.ÿ So let me first say what this part of the prayer doesn't mean. It doesn't mean that we have to pray for forgiveness every time we pray or we won't be forgiven by God.ÿ Forgiveness is something that is given to us by God once and for all.ÿ And just to clarify this, let's look at a passge out of Hebrewsÿ10ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The second thing this passage is not saying is that God will only forgive us if we forgive others. The reason he puts these two ideas together is that they are so connected.ÿ The reason we forgive others is because we have been forgiven.ÿ Jesus is teaching us here that forgiveness of other people is connected to the fact that we have been forgiven. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In fact, later in the book of Matthew he tells the story of a guy who was forgiven an outrageous debt, like 10 million dollars.ÿ But then he goes to his friend and starts to choke him because his friend owes him a lousy dollar! And Jesus' point is that forgiveness by God for all we've done, implies that we should forgive others. Now the reason he puts it in this prayer, as something we should pray about all the time, is that forgiveness is something we really need help with.ÿ Forgiveness of others is a big, big deal.ÿ Isn't it amazing?ÿ There are only three basic things he highlights in this part of the prayer, and one of them is forgiveness of other people. Now that I'm an old man, and lived a few years, I know why.ÿ It used to be I thought, ""Forgiveness?ÿ Sure!ÿ No big deal!""ÿ But I look back on my life now and realize that it has been perhaps the single hardest thing I've had to do.ÿ And it has been one of the most damaging issues, in my life and others. I was reflecting on it for this teaching.ÿ I cannot believe how many people have been wiped out in their Christian lives because of their failure to forgive. But it makes all the sense in the world.ÿ How can love and hate coexist together?ÿ The Christian life is about love.ÿ And when we don't forgive someone, it is so contrary to the spirit of God within us, it grieves him.ÿ That is the first thing Paul lists in Eph.ÿ4:31 which grieves the Spirit of God within us. When we fail to forgive, it may not feel like hate.ÿ It rarely feels like hate for me.ÿ I don't go around gnashing my teeth about people.ÿ It just feels like, ""Well, I'm gonna lose that idiot out of my life!"" It totally grieves God because his posture with us is, ""I love you no matter what!ÿ There's nothing you could ever do to take my love away!"" Let me warn you about something.ÿ If you fail to forgive, or cut someone out of your life, you may think you are going to really hurt that person or get even with them.ÿ But let me warn you, if you fail to forgive, you will be destroyed.ÿ It will ruin your life.ÿ If there is even one person in your life you cannot forgive, then that's enough to destroy you. I know this from passages other than this one.ÿ For example later in this chapter, Jesus says that if you are on your way to worship God, and you remember that you have something against your brother, stop.ÿ Stop right there and go make things right with your brother.ÿ Then you can go worship God.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04703.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",
"Christian Life: The Bible",1993-01-15,,"  God's Word <h1>Intro</h1> I was thinking about this subject and I was trying to imagine what it would be like if God never communicated.ÿ What if God never said anything?ÿ Here we are in his world, which he created.ÿ And he never says anything to us?! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It would be like if you were an orphan.ÿ If you're an orphan, you know you have parents.ÿ But you constantly wonder, ""Where are they?ÿ Do they care about me?ÿ Why have they left me alone here?"" There could be some people here who identify with that feeling because it has really happened to them.ÿ It wouldn't be the kind of thing you thought about all the time.ÿ But it would be back there, in your mind.ÿ It would be something that bothered you. Well, what about God?ÿ What about going through your life and never having God, your creator, reach out to you?ÿ How would that be? The Bible contemplates just such a scenario.ÿ Because the fact is many people do go through life without a word from God, without any instructions or communication. <h1>Prov.ÿ29:18</h1> There is one passage which is kind of famous, which speaks about what happens to people who don't receive a word from God for a long time.ÿ It's a verse that sometimes Christians use to talk about vision in the church.ÿ It is Provÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Then the way people take that is ""vision"" in the sense of an outlook for the future.ÿ I've heard it used to say that unless a person has a vision for their future, some kind of plan, then they will perish. But the term is a term that refers to vision in the sense of revelation, a word from God.ÿ And of course that is what makes sense of the verse because the Proverbs are often written in contrasts.ÿ And the contrast here is that with God's instruction, the law, a person can be happy. ""The people throw off restraint,"" is a sad picture.ÿ It's not a picture of someone who's saying, ""Yea, we're free!""ÿ It is the picture of someone who feels that they are without guidance.ÿ Their life is without order.ÿ It's the picture of someone who is lost.ÿ It's exactly the scenario of a child who has lost his parents and doesn't know what to do. This passage is telling us that when a person is without God's word, they are adrift at sea.ÿ They are aimless and without direction. <h2>You have to compensate</h2> I've been in this state.ÿ I've been in the state where you feel like God's not invovled in my life at all.ÿ I've felt like he never has anything to say to me.ÿ I don't get any guidance from him at all. I remember that lost feeling, where I would just kind of think, ""What am I going to do?""ÿ I would compensate for the lack of any guidance in my life.ÿ A lot of times I would compensate by just sitting back and going nowhere.ÿ You know how that is when you're in life and you're going nowhere and you know it?ÿ You just kind of feel like you're going through each day and it's like the day before. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's like you're crossing a giant desert with little hills.ÿ And each day you go over one more hill and there's another one that looks just like it ahead of you. But then there's the weekend, which represents some kind of relief from the monotony.ÿ You'll talk louder, drink more, etc. But I've spent long times just going over one hill after another and just settling into that feeling of going nowhere.ÿ You just get used to it, or learn to survive. Other people have compensated for a lack of guidance, a lack of God's word in their lives, by gunning for various goals.ÿ They set goals and then throw themselves at those goals. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I'm getting this degreeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I'm going into the marinesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I'm getting this manÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I'll bet you could go through life hopping from one little goal to the next.ÿ But of course, by the end of your life, it would be pretty depressing.ÿ Because there still wouldn't be the big picture there of ""what does my life matter?ÿ What does my life count?"" That has to come from God.ÿ Because he's the one who puts all of life in perspective.ÿ He's the one who puts all of human history in it's place.ÿ And he's the one who will be there in the next life to give it meaning as well. <h1>I Sam. 3</h1> When you've been in a drought of God's word, and you haven't had him speaking to you, you haven't had any communication from God, what begins to happen to you is that you become cynical.ÿ You become a person who doesn't expect to hear from God.ÿ You don't see God's hand at work anywhere, and most of all in your own life. There's an interesting story about this in the book of IÿSam.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In I Sam. 3 Samuel, who became one of the greatest prophets and priests of God in the Bible, was just a young boy.ÿ And he lived in the temple because he was in training to become a priest.ÿ His mentor, the old priest, was a guy named Eli.ÿ And he also slept in the temple area in an adjoining room. Well, what happened was that God came and talked to Samuel one night.ÿ And I want to look at Samuel's response. <h2>The word was rareÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> The first thing the author tells us is that the word of God was rare in those days.ÿ There was a drought of the word of God.ÿ This is what I'm talking about right here.ÿ What happens to a person when they don't hear from God?ÿ When God never speaks? Next it tells us that Eli was asleep in his place.ÿ And the lamp was still going.ÿ This was a lamp that was supposed to burn all night in the temple.ÿ Probably what the author is telling us is that it was very, very late in the night, maybe just before the oil in the lamp would normally burn out.ÿ So, nobody else is up.ÿ Samuel is all alone. <h2>Then the Lord called to Samuelÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Then it says that God called to Samuel.ÿ It's obvious that what we're talking about here is an auditory communication.ÿ God speaks out loud and Samuel hears him. His response is, ""Here I am!""ÿ And he looks around, and thinks, ""It must have been Eli.""ÿ So he runs into the next room and says, ""What did you want?"" Eli tells him it wasn't him.ÿ Go back to bed.ÿ This is really interesting, in light of what happens next. <h2>The Lord called againÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> It says that the Lord called again.ÿ And what does Samuel assume?ÿ He assumes it had to be the voice of Eli again.ÿ Now this had to be really wierd.ÿ You hear this voice, and you know that something really unusual is happening.ÿ It had to occur to Samuel that this might be the voice of God or something.ÿ But he doesn't want to conclude that.ÿ So he goes to Eli againÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>The text explainsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Then the author explains Samuel's hesitance to believe it was the voice of God.ÿ He says this was before Samuel had a relationship with God, and before he had ever heard the voice of God. So, this is exactly the state that we were talking about.ÿ We're talking about what it would be like to never hear a word from the Lord.ÿ And I think his text gives us a little insight here.ÿ When there's a drought of God's word, then you don't expect to hear from him. Samuel tried to explain away what was happening to him.ÿ He was just like you and me.ÿ He didn't expect to be woken up at night with voices from heaven.ÿ If he heard a voice, then he assumed it was coming from the next room. <h2>One more timeÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Well, it happened one more time.ÿ We read in v.ÿ8ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This time, Eli recognized what was happening.ÿ And he told Samuel to stay there and say, ""What do you want God?"" (read v.ÿ9) This time God spoke the message to Samuel.ÿ And it wasn't a very positive message.ÿ God told Samuel that Eli and his sons were going to die.ÿ But that's a side-note.ÿ What I want you to see here is that God waited until Samuel recognized him for who he was.ÿ God waited until Samuel was willing to believe it was the voice of God.ÿ God wouldn't speak until Samuel realized, ""OK, this is God.ÿ What do you want to say to me God?"" <h2>Lessons from this story</h2> I think we can learn a couple great lessons from this story.ÿ One is, that if you are someone who has been experiencing a drought of God's word, then you are probably cynical about it as well.ÿ By cynical I meanÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And this is understandable.ÿ But you have to decide if you want God to speak to you again, and if you are willing to acknowledge his voice when he does. <h1>How does he speak?</h1> The question left for us is, how does God speak to us today?ÿ How does God's word come to us today? <h2>Not necessarily through subjective encounters</h2> The first instinct a lot of people have is to think that God's word should come to people subjectively, by way of a vision or some kind of a feeling. But the problem is that our impressions and feelings and psychological experiences often tell more about us than they do about God.ÿ Each person has their way of looking at things.ÿ Each one of us has the feelings we like the best, and our pet topicsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember last year some time getting the impression that I need to be more hard on people.ÿ I got this impression while I was praying or something.ÿ So I wondered whether it was possibly a word from the Lord.ÿ Problem is, every time I told anyone about it, they laughed at me! If you know me very well, you know that they reason they laughed is that's the way I am.ÿ I am hard on people.ÿ And if I need to work on anything, it's probably being easier on people.ÿ So, more than likely I told myself that I need to be more hard on people. <h2>God has chosen the scriptures</h2> No, the way God has chosen to speak to us is through a written medium, external to ourselves.ÿ He has chosen the scriptures.ÿ He has chosen a means of expressing himself that is not quite as subject to our whims and desires.ÿ It's a medium that is outside of ourselves, so it more reflects him and what he wants to say than it does us. But what I want you to see is that he really wants to speak.ÿ He doesn't want us to just read a book.ÿ He wants to speak to us through that book.ÿ He wants it to be so powerful, and so clear that it's as if he was standing right in front of you speaking to you. And if you are a Christian who is experiencing God's word, you know what I mean. <h3>Hebrews 4:12</h3> Here's what I'm talking aboutÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>2 Tim. 3:16</h3> Again, the word of God is useful, meaning that it has it's impact. <h3>Isaiah 55:11</h3> This is one of my favorites.ÿ God says, ""I will have an effect with my wordÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" <h2>What should you do?</h2> You guys should be into this book in a serious way.ÿ It's not enough to come here once a week.ÿ You need to be in the scriptures, letting God speak to you almost daily. Let me give you some ideas on how you can be in the scriptures frequently in a way that is not wooden, or the same old thing day after day. <h3>Teachings</h3> <h3>Personal study</h3> <h3>Books</h3> <h3>Tapes</h3> <h3>Seminars</h3>",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04704.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",
"Christian Life: The Church",1993-01-22,,"  The Church <h1>Christians go to church</h1> Chrisitians go to church.ÿ That's what they do.ÿ If you are a Christian, then you'll have to go to church.ÿ I believe that church could be the most intimidating part of Christianity. It's intimidating because it has a lot of associations.ÿ Church is associated with boredom.ÿ It's associated with self-righteous people.ÿ It's associated with judgment.ÿ It's associated with ritual and elaborate dress.ÿ It's associated with singing. So there are a lot of associations with the church that to some folks are unpleasant. But let me try to explain the nature of the church and what it's really all about by going to the apostle Paul.ÿ Paul, without a doubt, explains to us the church more than any other biblical author.ÿ I want to talk about Paul's conversion to Christianity.ÿ Because in the course of Paul's conversion experience, he learned some things about the church that were very powerful. <h1>Paul</h1> <h2>A religious leaderÿ.ÿ.ÿ. persecutor</h2> If you know anything about Paul's conversion experience, it was a dramatic one.ÿ There was nothing subtle about it. Just to inform you of who Paul was, the most important thing to realize about Paul before he became a Christian is that he was important.ÿ He was a man of all kinds of influence.ÿ When you have the authority to do what Paul did, then you are well-connected. And what it is that Paul did was persecute Christians.ÿ But he didn't just persecute Christians.ÿ He had some of them put to death.ÿ That was no easy thing to do in those days, when Israel was under Roman domination.ÿ The Romans didn't just let you kill people.ÿ That was their domain.ÿ And for them to give that right to anyone else meant that person had a lot of clout. But Paul was even more unusual.ÿ In Actsÿ9, he got letters to go to another province altogether, outside of Israel.ÿ And he was going there to see if there were any Christians he could capture and drag back to Jerusalem to stand trial. So Paul had been given the power of life and death over people.ÿ But he had also been given powers that normally would be reserved for the army--the ability to go between provinces, capture people and bring them to stand trial, possibly even to kill them. This guy had clout.ÿ He was important.ÿ In Jewish religious circles he had power, which he describes in a passage like Phil.ÿ3.ÿ But also, even with the Romans he had clout.ÿ And one reason we know is that Paul's parents were actually Roman citizens, and apparently quite wealthy. As I said, he was a persecutor of the church.ÿ He thought this Christian church was a cancer, an evil group of people that had to be rooted out and destroyed. <h2>On his wayÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> On his way to the city of Damascus one day, on a mission to find and bring back Christians, Paul had an eye-opening experience.ÿ Something happened that changed his perspective forever about the church. (read vv. 1-6) ""Why are you persecuting me?""ÿ ""Who are you?""ÿ ""I am Jesus Christ, who you are persecuting!"" Paul thought he was persecuting errant, deviant Christians.ÿ But Christ says, ""You are persecuting me.""ÿ This is when it first began to dawn on Paul that the church is not merely humans, who believe something or meet somewhere.ÿ The church is somehow Jesus Christ on this earth. <h2>I Cor. 12:27; Col. 1:17, 18; Eph. 1:22, 23</h2> Let's look at a few passages from Paul's letters, which come after the book of Acts in the NT, where he develops this notion of the church as spiritually connected to Christ.ÿ Very simply, in IÿCor.ÿ12:27 he says, Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it. Paul uses this metaphor of Christ's body.ÿ The image is that he is the head, the authority, and that we are his hands and feet in this world.ÿ He uses the same metaphor in Col.ÿ1:17, 18, He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. He is also head of the body, the church. Again, it's the same metaphor which describes Christians as linked to Christ as a body is to a head. And then, in one of the most sweeping statements Paul makes about the church, he says in Eph.ÿ1:22, 23, And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all. To say that the church is the ""fullness of Christ,"" is a different way of talking than we would today.ÿ If I was going to translate this verse, I might say that the church is the complete manifestation of Christ on this earth.ÿ Or that the church is Christ on this earth. <h2>How is this so?</h2> I want to be careful to explain how this is so.ÿ How it is that the church is connected to Jesus Christ.ÿ How it is that the church is the expression of Christ on earth. When a person becomes a Christian, it means that they have appealed to God for forgiveness.ÿ It means that they have seen their sin and asked God for his mercy.ÿ That's what it is to become a Christian.ÿ But God does more than that.ÿ God comes to live inside of us. This is why Jesus promised, in John 14:16, 17, ""And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truthÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ you know Him because He abides with you, and will be in you. Christ promises that the Spirit of God will come and live inside. That's why, then, Christians and Christ are so connected.ÿ His Spirit lives inside of us. Just to get real practical, when someone becomes a Christian and asks, ""Do I have to join the church now?""ÿ The answer is, ""Not at all!ÿ You are the church!"" By receiving God's forgiveness, and having him come live inside of you, you automatically become part of him and part of his church.ÿ You are spiritually tied to Christ.ÿ And you are spiritually connected to all Christians, who also have his Spirit. There's something else that Paul learned about the church in this event. <h2>Wait for Annanias</h2> (read all the way through v. 18) This is the story of Paul's conversion to Christianity.ÿ And you can see in Paul's case that God used some pretty strong techniques to persuade him.ÿ He struck Paul temporarily blind, and then made him sit there and think about it for three days. Here's the point that's relevant for us: God could have then said, ""OK, Paul, you've thought about it enough,"" and removed his blindness.ÿ He could have told Paul how to become a Christian and all the things he needed to know.ÿ Instead he sent some average guy named Ananias, who we never hear from again, to bring an end to Paul's blindness and teach him what he needed to know. God taught Paul that these Christians, who he came to capture and take away, are the people he needs, even if Paul was the hottest shot in the whole world, even if Paul knew more Bible, even if this Ananias were a complete nobody and Paul had never heard of him before.ÿ Paul needed Ananias because God chose to work through Ananias rather than just do things himself. So, the second lesson we learn about the church from this story: God elects to do his work on earth through the church, rather than do it himself.ÿ He wants to work through people. The implications of this truth are immense.ÿ But before I get to that, I want to show you a passage where Paul taught this truth very clearly. <h2>1 Cor. 12:20-27</h2> In I Cor.ÿ12, which we've already looked at one verse out of, Paul uses this metaphor of the Body of Christ.ÿ And he uses it to teach this point, But now there are many members, but one body. And the eye cannot say to the hand, ""I have no need of you""; or again the head to the feet, ""I have no need of you."" On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessaryÿ.ÿ.ÿ. .ÿ.ÿ. so that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it. The points he is making here are the same points that God taught him so powerfully through Ananias.ÿ If you are a Christian, you can't look over there to the other Christian and say, ""I have no need of you.""ÿ If Paul had tried to say that about the lowly Christian God sent to him, he could have stayed blind for the rest of his life. We need other people because God lives inside of them and chooses to work through them. I think another point Paul makes here is he explains the genius of the church.ÿ He says that the result of God doing things this way is that there will be ""no division in the body,"" and ""all the members will care for each other."" This is the answer.ÿ When you wonder, ""Why do I have to listen to other people!?ÿ Why do I have to have him help me!?""ÿ The answer is, if we didn't need people, then we wouldn't bother ourselves with people.ÿ If we didn't need people, we would constantly drift apart from them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This was something that God went to work on with me by accentuating my loneliness.ÿ I think the Lord does this with people.ÿ Just like he struck Paul with blindness so that later he would see his need to be delivered by his fellow Christians, I think he causes our weaknesses to become more evident, so that we'll see our need for his people.ÿ Before I was a Christians, I used to handle my loneliness with various escapes.ÿ And I was simply able to harden my heart and ignore that voice down there that said, ""You're lonely, you're loveless.""ÿ But God made it like a voice that slowly grew stronger until it was a shout inside of meÿ.ÿ.ÿ. it drove me crazy.ÿ At first it made me drink a lot moreÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But even that didn't work.ÿ After a while I had to admit, ""I need these Christiansÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ That was so hard for me.ÿ I can't tell you how hard that was. <h1>Applications</h1> Just to wrap up, I want to think of some applications of what we've learned. <h2>God works through all kinds</h2> The first one is that God works through all kinds of people.ÿ The key to a human being God's instrument on this earth is not the way that person is, but the fact that God lives inside of them. The longer you are a Christian, the more you will see that God uses people who are very screwed up. So, it's no use saying, ""I can't be helped by that guy because he has all kinds of problems."" <h2>Get in a position where you can be helped</h2> Practially speaking, if you are a Christian, you must get into a position where God can use other people in your life.ÿ What this means is that you have to have regular, meaningful contact with people.ÿ They need to know youÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I came to this church here, I exuded a message.ÿ And that message was, ""Leave me alone.""ÿ The sad thing is that after a while, I didn't want to give off that message anymore!ÿ I didn't want people to leave me alone.ÿ But they had already heard it loud and clear. I see some of you giving off that message.ÿ And if you want to be safe from other people, then I guess you can.ÿ I've found that you can make your little world a somewhat safe place, but it's also a very cold place. If you're going to let people into your life, you've got to put out the green light.ÿ You've got to invite people.ÿ You've got to tell them, ""I want you to get involved in my life.""ÿ Because people are scared to take a risk and find out about you, especially if you've been giving off a message that says, ""Leave me alone."" <h2>Begin to ask God how you can be used in other people's lives</h2> Thirdly, begin to ask God how you can be used in the lives of others.ÿ I really believe that if you're asking God, and keeping your eyes open, you will find opportunities to be used by God in other people's lives also.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04705.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",

"People who were Close to God: Jacob: Not the Godly Type",1993-03-04,,"  <h1>Jacob: essentially lives a life of struggle</h1> What we see in the life of this fellow Jacob is a life of struggle.ÿ This is what his name means, ""Jacob,"" ""the caniver,"" the supplanter.""ÿ His second name as well, which God gives him later, means ""one who strives with God."" What I want to draw attention to in Jacob's life is that he was blessed by God.ÿ Jacob's life was successful.ÿ But Jacob's success was in spite of his caniving, manipulating ways, not because of them.ÿ In other words, whatÿ we see inÿ Jacob'sÿ life is something a lot of us should relate to.ÿ God promises, ""I want to bless you.""ÿ But Jacob never really just takes God at his word.ÿ He constantly struggles, thinking that he has to take care of things himself. So this is a story of God's mercy, God's blessing, on a person in spite of the fact that that person is constantly coniving and struggling to take care of things himself. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You could think of a kid.ÿ And his parents promise to take care of him, give him an allowance, etc.ÿ But the kid never really takes them at their word.ÿ So he steals money from around the house.ÿ He constantly tries to trick his parents into giving him things.ÿ And generally he just doesn't believe their promise.ÿ But they remain faithful to him anyway. <h2>He knows of God's intentions (Gen. 25:23)</h2> The first sign we get that God wants to bless Jacob is when he and his twin brother were born.ÿ God told Rebecca, his mom, ""The older one will serve the younger one.""ÿ God revealed that he would be closer to the younger one and help him. And, this is why Jacob was always Rebecca's favorite.ÿ She knew God's intention. <h2>Then he sets about to grasp it.</h2> It's very interesting what happens in Jacob's life.ÿ Since his brother was older, he hadÿ the rights to certain things.ÿ For example, he had the rights of inheritance.ÿÿ So Esau would normally be considered the greater of the two.ÿ But Jacob sets out to undo nature.ÿ He wants toÿ turn that around.ÿÿ The first thing he does is cheat his brother out of the right of inheritance.ÿ He does by waiting for an opportune moment, when Esau is really hungryÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Then there's something else.ÿ Jacob wants the blessing of his father.ÿ Normally, the blessing was given to the eldest.ÿ The blessing was very important.ÿ They really regarded it.ÿ So Jacob wants to get it.ÿ What he did then was even more sneaky and tricky.ÿ He posed as his brother Esau, and he went into his fatherÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, in the end, Jacob winds up with both the right of inheritance from his father and his father's blessing.ÿ Both should have been Esau's. Esau observes, ""Is he not rightly called the supplanter, swindler, because.ÿ.ÿ."" (Gen.ÿ27:36) So Jacob, the supplanter, has succeded in sweeping aside all the customs of premogeniture, swept aside his brother, and placed himself in the front seat.ÿ But here is what I want you to see about Jacob.ÿ God had already said, ""I will bless Jacob.ÿ He will be greater than his brother.""ÿ But Jacob swindled, manipulated and canived his way ahead of his brother.ÿ That's a principle we can work with right there. <h2>God sends him on a mission</h2> As a result of all this, God sends Jacob on a mission in ch.28 to his uncle Laban.ÿ Now on the surface it seems like the mission is for the purpose of finding a wife among Laban's daughters.ÿ But it becomes apparent that there is much more afoot than this.ÿ God has some things in store for Jacob. <h3>He recieves a promise from God</h3> One striking event which happens to him on the way to stay with Laban is the vision we call, ""Jacob's ladder."" (Gen.ÿ28:13ff.)ÿ This is where God appears to Jacob and reaffirms his commitment to bless Jacob. I want you to notice how unconditional the wording is here.ÿ No matter what happens, I will not leave you.ÿ I will bring you back hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We migh be tempted to think, ""Boy, why or how could God work with someone like Jacob?""ÿ Because as you read about him, you do get kind of an unsavory taste, after what he has done to his brother and his father.ÿ But what's more, this man is not a ""man of God.""ÿ This is not a guy, like Abraham, who prays to God and builds altars to God.ÿ This is a secular man.ÿ He is off to do <strong>his</strong> thing.ÿ And yet, God blesses him. This is so typical of God, really.ÿ It's a good picture of the way that God pursues us, to love us.ÿ Regardless of his behavior, God is going to bless. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the fact that God is also going to learn him a thing or two. <h3>He falls in love with Rachel (ch.29)</h3> First, he sees one of Laban's daughters and falls in love.ÿ He is in love to such an extent that he is willing to become an indentured servant for seven years in order to get her! In fact, sometimes I wonder whether it wasn't Moses' wife who wrote this section.ÿ It says that Jacob labored these seven years, and it was as if it was a few days! <h3>But Laban slips him his other daughter (29:23)</h3> Well, the wedding night comes up, and Laban calls all the men-folk together.ÿ Here's where we get a glimpse of what was special about Uncle Laban. Now the way they did weddings in those days was to have a party, with the woman veiled.ÿ Then the couple would go off and consumate the marriage. This situation allowed for a few surprises.ÿ Namely, Laban was able to slip his other daughter on Jacob.ÿ.ÿ. In this, we find Jacob the swindler being out-swindled.ÿ Jacob deceived his father by replacing the older with the younger, and Laban deceived Jacob by replacing the younger with the older. <h3>So Jacob works another 7 years!</h3> Nevertheless, Jacob is still in love.ÿ So he is willing to work another seven years.ÿ.ÿ. They could do this in those days and it was acceptable. Laban read Jacob just right.ÿ He saw that he could get away with this.ÿ He saw that he could get away with 14 years of service instead of just 7. <h3>Then it came time to leave</h3> Then it came time to leave.ÿ Normally, a servant like Jacob would be givn some recompense, something to get started with.ÿÿ So he got together with Laban and they agreed, ""From now on, keep the striped sheep."" What he didn'tÿ tell Laban, though,ÿ was that God had come to him in a vision.ÿ God had told him that the irregular sheep would breed faster.ÿ ""So make a deal with Laban for the irregular sheep."" Again, it wasn't enough for Jacob that God promised the irregularÿ sheep would breed more.ÿ He started to doo this strange thing.ÿ He took the sheep down to water themÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Laban seesÿ that the striped sheep are doing better, so he changes the dealÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Eventually Jacob isÿ wondering how to make a mottled stickÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In the end,ÿ it isÿ clear again that God is the one blessing Jacob.ÿ It'sÿ not Jacob's caniving ways.ÿÿ It's notÿ his cleverness.ÿ It's not his special tricks with the sticks.ÿ It was God having mercy on him. Well, when it actually was time to go, Jacob was worried about Laban's jealousy.ÿ So he decided to sneak out. God had told Jacob, ""I will protect you.ÿ I will prosper you.""ÿ But Jacob can't trust in that. Again, Jacob takes matters into his own hands and finds a way to do things underhandedly--he sneaks off.ÿ He actually believes that he can, throug his own cleverness, protect himself and take care of himself.ÿ ""God's kindly promise was one thing, but I'm going to have to take care of matters here."" Well, little does he know, God has to cover his tracks.ÿ God comes personally to Laban and says, ""Hands off"" (<strong>31:24</strong>). Again, weÿ have God promising to protect Jacob.ÿ But Jacob tries to take care of things himself.ÿ And so, as usual, God has to protect Jacob. <h1>One final struggle: Esau (32:3-8)</h1> Then we get to ch.32 where Jacob has to go through his toughest struggle yet.ÿ He is about to encounter Esau, the one who knows him, who can't be fooled again.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ Who also has a score to settle. So, as Jacob approaches his homeland, a sense of dread grows in the pit of his stomachÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Esau is coming with 400 men!</h2> <strong>Read starting in v.3</strong> Jacob starts the same old way, greasing palms and trying to manuever his way around.ÿ Instead, he hears 400 men are coming. At this point, Jacob is terrified and realizes, this may be it for many of us.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Jacob's strange reaction (vv. 7ff.)</h2> Then, in the face of this great struggle, Jacob has a strange reaction.ÿ For the first time ever, according to the record, Jacob addresses God and starts to pray fervently. And look at the content of his prayer.ÿ.ÿ. Now he comes to God and says, ""You promised, come through."" For the first time, instead of saying, ""You promised, now <strong>I'll</strong> deliver,"" he says, ""you promised, <strong>you</strong> deliver.""ÿ And Jacob has amazing recall of exactly what God has promised him. So in this sense, Jacob feels he has come to the end of the line.ÿ He knows that his bag of tricks is wearing thin.ÿ So Jacob is saying, ""I can't go on like this, it's getting me nowhere!"" <h2>God knows better</h2> Fortunately, however, God knew better.ÿ He knew there was actually quite a bit of fight left in the man. <h2>Still one crucial lesson</h2> On top of this, there was still one crucial lesson Jacob had to learn.ÿ He still had not seen through the meaning of his life-long struggle.ÿ And that is, that all his struggle, all his caniving, <em>was ultimately against God</em>. Jacob wanted to look at things on the horizontal.ÿ He wanted to look out here and say, ""Look, my brother Esau is in the way.""ÿ Or, ""Look, Laban is thwarting the blessing that's rightfully mine."" But the fact is, it was God who promised those things.ÿ It was God who was going to come through.ÿ But Jacob didn't like that.ÿ He didn't like leaving things in the hands of God.ÿ He had to take care of them himself. Really, his struggle was against God.ÿ His struggle was whether he would humbly submit himself to God and receive his promises, or whether he would go out and seize them himself by whatever means possible.ÿ It was a crisis of trust.ÿ He couldn't trust this God, he had to fight to get what he wanted. At the bottom of it all, it was a struggle against God himself. <h2>One of the strangest stories in the Bible (vv. 22ff.)</h2> This is why we see, in the next few paragraphs one of the strangest stories in the whole Bible. <h1>The wrestling match</h1> Jacob pealed away from the others.ÿ And he sent all kinds of flocks and gifts ahead of him.ÿ But, he knows that's not going to work.ÿ So, he apparently feels the need for one more night alone--a night of anxiety, a night of tension and fear. And this is where God comes to meet him. This is evident from v.30 where Jacob says he came face to face with God himself.ÿ God reveals himself in some kind of human form, something he has done before and is fully capable of doing.ÿ ""Here I am.ÿ I think you want to fight with me.""ÿ And Jacob had so much fight in him, he fought all night! Jacob proves to be just as tenacious and dogged as he has been his whole life.ÿ Jacob was a winner.ÿ Sure, he had always had to struggle, but then he prevailed. This is a great quality I'm sure.ÿ But it needs to be tamed.ÿ So God tames the man.ÿ He reaches inside his hip and dislocates it.ÿ From now on Jacob has to do some limping to get around. But Jacob clings on, now being dragged on the ground.ÿ And he asks God for a blessing.ÿ And this is really quite remarkable, as Jacob reflects later.ÿ Instead of dealing a death blow, God does bless him.ÿ He gives him a name, which was immeasurably more significant in his day than ours.ÿ And it happens to be the name of the people of Jacob today. Well, God did Jacob in that night.ÿ He effectively exposed to Jacob the real object of his struggle: God himself.ÿ And he reached in and tamed Jacob's tenacity.ÿ God brought that struggling ability to heal.ÿ And he blessed Jacob. What are the lessons we're going to glean from this story? <h2>We all struggle</h2> The first would be that we struggle.ÿ Jacob's struggle was certainly not unique.ÿ He, like us, knew that God wanted to bless.ÿ But that wasn't good enough.ÿ He couldn't just trust God and follow him. Does that sound familiar? <h3>Some struggles are indirect, trying to get our way</h3> The way this works out in our life is either a) we don't like the way God has arranged things in our life so we resist, or b) we don't believe he will really take care of something so we struggle to grasp that thing for ourselves. In essence, we are struggling against God.ÿ We don't believe he is going to come through on what he has promised, or we don't like the way he has come through, so we fight against him. Now, of course, no one is so crass as to say, ""I'm fighting against God because he hasn't come through yet.""ÿ We consider ourselves to be fighting for what we deserve. I don't know how many areas this applies to, a lot. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In the area of relationships this happens.ÿ We know that God created male-female relationships.ÿ We know that he likes them, he likes marriage.ÿ He likes men and women to be friends and get close.ÿ Now, I can't be positive that it's God's will for every person to get married.ÿ I can't be positive that it's God's will for every person to be dating.ÿ But I do know that it's God's will for all Christians to have satisfying love relationships in their lives.ÿ But people aren't content with that.ÿ In our view, God's got to meet our needs in such-and-such a way, by such-and-such a time.ÿ And if he doesn't!?ÿ If he doesn't, I'll take care of it myself!!ÿ I don't know how many Christians I have heard by now who says, essentially, ""At this point, I'm going to do what I want.ÿ I'm going to chase the man or woman I want.ÿ I'm going to do what I want."" Well, you don't have to convince me, if you feel that way.ÿ Your struggle is with God.ÿ It's not with any other person, here or anywhere else.ÿ Someone may have the nerve to speak into our lives and say, ""Have you considere whether the thing you're doing is what God wants?""ÿ And all of the sudden, that person catches all our wrathÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We struggle to get our way.ÿ And our struggle is against God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've seen this struggle go on in my own life in the area of finances.ÿ I remember as I ran a business and tried to put my way through school, there were times when customers wouldn't come through with payments, at the same time as all my tuition and other bills would be due.ÿ And I would get livid with anger at anything that stood in my way!ÿ I could not believe that all this crap came down on me at once!ÿ And as I would be in the middle of one of my little tirades, the thought might occur to me, ""Why don't you pray?""ÿ And I knew, ""There's no way I'm gonna pray!ÿ Because he's the one who has let all this happen!"" That's a good way to expose our hearts on this.ÿ At the time of greatest anxiety, fear and anger over some situation, say to yourself, ""Oh, let's just sit right down here and thank God, and just entrust this whole thing to him.""ÿ ""No way!"" But why not?ÿ Why not?ÿ Because you are fighting with him. Other people will do the same thing, but more passively and subtely.ÿ In fact, that's kind of the way Jacob was.ÿ He just went and did what he wanted.ÿ He got what he wanted, and he never expressely made his struggle against God.ÿ God had to press the point by coming to fight with him. So, we'll see people go about their lives, and it's not that they're angry at God and shaking their fist at him.ÿ It's that they don't want to know what he thinks of their endeavors.ÿ Because if they really knew, then they'd have to change. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People will say, ""I'm going to be a (you fill in the blank).""ÿ ""Well, have you sought out God about that?ÿ Do you think this is where the Lord wants you?""ÿ And the answer that comes back is, ""Why wouldn't he want me here?""ÿ Meaning, ""No, I haven't, and what could possibly stand in my way!?""ÿ I don't know.ÿ I don't know if anything will stand in your way.ÿ But the point is, we're trying to sneak by God to go do what we want. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's like I always used to do at home with my parents.ÿ I would wait until they were busy with TV, or going to the bathroom.ÿ And then I would casually, but swiftly walk through the room and go outside.ÿ I didn't know if they would say no.ÿ I just didn't want to take the chance, so I went and did my thing. We do this with God.ÿ And in so doing, we struggle against God. I think the example of career is such a good one.ÿ Because so many young people get a picture in their minds and they gun for it.ÿ And they think to themselves, ""And later, when I'm established in my career, I'll figure out how God can use me there!""ÿ Why that order of things?ÿ Why?ÿ Why not first establish yourself with the Lord, see how he can use you in this life, and then figure out a career that would be suited to that!? Instead we struggle against God, we hide from him to get our way. <h3>Signs of fighting with God</h3> <h4>Is your prayer life thin?</h4> But this I mean, do you just go over cursor, obligatory topics and say ""amen""?ÿ Or do you really fellowship with God?ÿ It's hard to fellowship with someone when you're trying to slide by him and struggle with him. <h4>Do you enjoy God's word?</h4> I say, ""enjoy,"" because I know from experience that it is possible to get into the Bible just like any other book.ÿ But do you get insight from it?ÿ Does it speak to you?ÿ Do you get excited about what you see there and feel like you have to share it with others? <h4>Are you frustrated with people/circumstances?</h4> What I'm talking about here is that sense of chaffing and anger we feel towards others.ÿ They're causing our life to be uncomfortable, so we feel angry about them. I think our reaction in these kinds of situations of often just like Jacob's, we try to slip out by the cover of night. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember I had a boss once who drove me nuts.ÿ Like they say, she was something that rhyms with ""witch.""ÿ And I was going to quit one day, when someone reminded me, ""Have you learned what you're supposed to learn from that situation yet?ÿ Or are you just going to come and go on that job, concluding the only problem was with her?ÿ Because if you do that, there'll just be another, similar situation come up later."" I knew that advice was correct.ÿ And I had to go back and try againÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h4>Are you alienated from strong Christians?</h4> This is a very telltale sign.ÿ When you look around you, there are always some strong believers, men and women who have really had their lives shaped by God.ÿ And maybe as a young Christian, you warmed right up to this.ÿ But now, now you really don't like to be around them. In fact, I have gotten to the point that I see more things wrong with the older, mature Christians in my life than anyone else! Why is this?ÿ Have you ever stopped to think why this is, honestly?ÿ I know why it is in my life.ÿ It's because those people represent God.ÿ Those people think like he does--at least more than I do.ÿ Those people will give me God's perspective on things.ÿ In other words, they won't just agree with my point of view. So I hate them.ÿ And I find things wrong with them. <h4>Have you seen God work lately?</h4> Ask yourself if you have seen God work through you to others lately.ÿ Or if you have seen him change things in your own life lately.ÿ Because often there will be a lapse of God's power when we are struggling with him. This is a real important one too because some of the others we can deceive ourselves in.ÿ And we can decieve ourselves and others here too, but it's a little bit harder. <h4>Conclude</h4> Well, I mention these signs so you can reflect on your relationship with God.ÿ And I think this is healthy.ÿ I would really encourage you to get with someone and think about these kinds of signs.ÿ Because alone, by myself, I can be either too negative or to blindÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>God allows the struggle</h2> Well, OK, God lets that go on.ÿ This is OK in his book.ÿ In fact, he has the ability to engineer some interesting circumstances to enhance our struggle. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: With Jacob, he found someone who was a better chisler. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In my own life, I've been amazed at how he will do this.ÿ I remember being under teachers who were just incredibly haughty and arrogant (at least that's how I felt at the time, but it may have been more projecting myself onto them than anything else).ÿ But at the same time, they were also incredibly wrong about their views.ÿ And I used to chafe so under these teachers.ÿ ""Oh, how can I even endure one more day at the hands of this foolish teacher!?""ÿ Of course, the biggest problem of all was, they had a lot more wood on the ball than me and they could kick my butt in an argument.ÿ And I knew, God has put me here to get a caning.ÿ He has given me something hard to throw myself against. God will let us go on in our struggle.ÿ And he will inject a few surprises along the way. <h2>God returns</h2> Then, the amazing thing is, when we finally reach the end of our rope, like Jacob did, God is there.ÿ When Jacob finally got on his knees and said, ""Oh God, help me,"" God showed up. Remember, he hasn't been the one running away.ÿ We're the one who struggles.ÿ He's been waiting for that moment when we come to him in surrender. <h2>God blesses</h2> But then, and finally, as we come to the end of our rope and begin to realize that it is actually God I've been struggling against all this time, God does something even more amazing: He blesses us.ÿ Just like he did with Jacob. This is so amazing.ÿ And it is so characteristic of God. It's as if to say, ""Look what you have been struggling against all this time!ÿ A God who wants to bless you!ÿ You have been fighting against the one who wants to turn you on to something good!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Remember, this is the way he had been with Jacob all his lifeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>When we become Christians</h3> This scenario I have been laying out here of struggle against God is one that can happen even before we are Christians.ÿ I have been talking here tonight with a view to those of us who have a relationship with God.ÿ But I also know, that even before we become a Christian, and decide to have a relationship with him, we can have this same kind of struggle against God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I know how it was for me.ÿ There was the knowledge on my part that God was there.ÿ And there was the knowledge that he wanted me.ÿ At first it was a vague, almost invisible knowledge.ÿ But as I learned more about God, and I ran into more Christians, and saw how much life with God made sense, I began to realize, ""This guy wants into my life!""ÿ And somewhere in there my heels found a place to dig in.ÿ I fought that.ÿ Because I thought, ""What will he do with me?ÿ What kind of person is he going to turn me into?"" And I fought, right up to the day that I decided to let God come into my life and have a relationship with me.ÿ Only then did I realize, ""This guy has been chasing me because he loves me, not because he hates me!"" This is what God wants with each and every person.ÿ As Jesus says in Rev.ÿ3:20ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>God's blessing is tailored</h3> But, as I've talked about here tonight, this kind of struggle goes on in the Christian life as well.ÿ As issue after issue, we struggle with God. And the thing to remember is that God intends a blessing.ÿ And here's the part that we really need to understand: It's not just that God wants to bless you some day.ÿ ""OK, God wants to turn me on to a good thing some day, that's niceÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" No, he wants the very thing you are struggling about to turn into a blessing!ÿ That very thing you hate, and you resent him for letting it happen, <strong>that's</strong> where he wants to pull a blessing out of! Our reaction needs to be, ""OK, Lord, what is it?""ÿ Not, ""OK, OK!ÿ Enough already!ÿ What is it?!""ÿ In thankfulnessÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04792.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","People who were Close to God",
"People who were Close to God: David: Loved both God and Sin",1993-03-11,,"  <h1>Intro: A different time</h1> I want to talk about two events in David's life that will show some great lessons about his relationship with God. But first I think there are some peculiarities about David's time that we should understand. There are some differences between his time and ours that if we don't understand, will make for some real confusion. For one thing, in David's time, God was working with the nation of Israel. Now he's working with the whole world. Then, he only worked with the nation of Israel. His plan was very narrow in scope. What this amounted to was a very conservative plan. God's plan at that time was not to reach out and tell everyone about himself, like it is today. Instead he was focused more on preserving this tiny nation. He wanted to preserve them, because they were the ones who would write down the scriptures. And through them he would also bring the Messiah. The reason for that is that Jesus Christ had not yet come and died. So the Holy Spirit was not yet given. It's God's Spirit that makes us distinctive. It's God's Spirit who changes us. He gives us spiritual power for daily life. So God's people were not in any way distinctive. They were no different than anyone else. That is why they constantly fell into the same sins as those surrounding them. They constantly fell into idolotry, having multiple wives, etc. One result of this is that the goals of a believer's life were not too different from the goals of anyone esle's. For example, today a beleiver in God might want to live his life to see people meet Christ. Not so in those days. A believer in God might life his life to become a better warrior or a better farmer. And that would be it. So, David was a warrior king, not unlike other kings in the world. That's what he did. In the course of it, he had to count on God. That's where his relationship with God became dependant and needy. He didn't want to be the average king who established a kingdom. He wanted the credit and glory to go to God. He wanted God to defend the nation of Israel. I think this is real important for us to understand. Because where we might be concerned with having God change us into more loving people so we can have more of an effect for God in this world, that was not so much their concern. We don't find these OT believers praying for the same things because they didn't have the same goals in life. But the same elements of needing God, wanting to be close to God, etc., were there. That's why they are good examples for us. With those differences in mind, I'd like to look at a couple events in David's life that show us his great understanding of his relationship with God. <h1>Getting strengthened by the Lord (1 Sam. 30)</h1> The first happened early on in his life, before he was even king. David led a band of men and they had been part of a warring party. And when they came back, another warring party had come and taken all their things, their women, and their children! It tells us that they wept until they had no strength left. But then, on a more ominous note, ""They were talking of stoning David!"" They were upset with him. What a terrible position to be in. Here your family has been taken away. Your possession stolen. And on top of it all, the people blame you! They want your head now! Here's a situation where it would be very easy to collapse. Pressure situations sometimes come into my life, and my first instinct is to run and hide. My first instinct is to want to quit. If I had been there, I could imagine myself saying, ""To hell with you guys! You can find yourselves another leader! I lost my family too, you know!"" But that was not David's reaction. Read carefully, ""He went to be strengthened by the Lord."" <h2>In the Psalms (see Psa. 31:19-24; 33:13ff.;</h2> Here we see a key to David's relationship with God. He knew how to go to God for strength. He knew the secret of going directly to God and getting encouraged and strenthened, even when all the people around him wanted his head! If you know anything about David, you know that he was a man of prayer. He wrote most of the Psalms, which are prayers to God. And you would be amazed to know that about half of the 70+ Psalms David wrote were prayers asking for God's strength. David drew his strength from God. <h2>We don't normally go to God</h2> This would be such a great thing. But the problem is that's not what we normally do. When I'm drained, or depressed, or intimidated by something, my normal course is not to go to God for strength. When I'm anxious, I try to ignore it. I watch TV. I work on something. I do anything to ignore my anxiety. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember when I was in school, during finals week, I would go fishing, build something, work on my car, anything to avoid the pressure. When I'm depressed, I become a TV hound. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've watched shows like the Brady Bunch, The Price is Right, numerous televangelists, even the Juiceman! All because I just didn't want to think about anything. Of course the result of this is that you don't really get energized. You don't really get any strength. So I wish I was better at this. I wish I knew more about how to go to God directly and get strengthening, encouragement and energy from him. The kinds of things that intimidate us today are a little different. The prospect of making friends with people is intimidating. Relationships with the opposite sex are intimidating. Serving Christ, stepping into positions of leadership, sharing the gospel with people, public teaching, are all things that are intimidating. There are things that are draining and depressing are things like failure, work, school, rejection, and so on. So there's no doubt that all of us struggle with the same type of problem. And we also experience getting let down by other people. In any of these hardships, there are times when other people can't help you. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I'm one of those people who always tends to think no one can help me. ""Nobody understands me!"" But I know there are other people here who always, automatically go to others for help. And you know how disappointing people can be. Wouldn't it be nice if we knew how to go directly to God for strength? Like I said, I'm not the greatest at this myself. I feel like I need to learn from David. There are definitely a couple lessons we can learn from his practice of going to get strengthened by God. <h2>David knew he was weak</h2> First of all, David knew he was weak. You can't go and be strengthened by God if you don't really think you need it! This is one key to David's success. There were times when he really knew his own weakness. Look at this Psalm (109)ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The feeling that he is communicating here is neediness and weakness. The description of his physical state is not so much how he really is, as much as it is about how he feels. He feels like he's wasting away. This is why it's so hard for me to get strength from the Lord. I never let myself feel weak. I never want to get to the point where I'm really desparate. So I handle it. I take care of it. I watch TV. I power through.ÿ I don't have the experience of getting refreshed and energized by the Lord. <h2>Gospel</h2> By the way, this attitude right here is what we need to become Christians in the first place. To become a Christian is to get to the point in your life where you realize you need God. It's to come before God for the first time and say, ""God, I need your forgiveness. And I need you."" This is somethign you do in prayer between you and God. The basic idea is that God does love you. And he does want tohave a relationship with you. But first, we have to get to the point where we realize we need him. Specifically, we need to get to the point where we realize we need his forgiveness. And when we come to him humbly, asking for his forgiveness and asking him to come into our lives, his answer is yes. He is waiting.ÿ I hope some of you will think about that. <h2>He spent time with God</h2> Then, David spent time with God. Knowing his weakness, he went before the Lrod in prayer. And this is what the Psalms are all about. These are just a few samplings of David's times of prayer with God. Here again, what do I do? What do we normally do? We're feeling bad. And so we go to God and say, 'God, I'm feeling bad."" And that's it! What are you supposed to get from that? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You could imagine walking by my wife in the hallway. And as you pass by, ""Hey, I've been kind of depressed lately."" But what David did was he spent time. He thought things through with the Lord. And as he spent time with God he was strengthened. I have experienced this. In fact, on numerous occasions I have been needy enough that I stopped, got before God, and really talked things through with him. And it does feel good. It is an excellent experience, one that I come away from energized. But I have to admit that usually I'm either not needy (or don't feel like it), or I won't spend the time. <h1>Willing to sacrifice (2 Sam. 24)</h1> The second event I want to look at is similar to the first, because it also revolves around this notion of self-confidence. You see, David, on the one hand was acutely aware of his weakness. So he depended on God for strength. But he always had this tendency to be self-confident. He was a winner. And he knew it. And if he didn't keep that self-confidence in check, it wound up destroying him. This happened several times in the course of his lifetime. A lot of you mighit be familiar with the incident with Beth-Sheba, where he killed her husband in order to carry out an adulterous affair. And this all came about because David was lax about his own weakness. But there is an incident late in his life that was similar because of that self-confidence. This is recorded in 1ÿChroniclesÿ21 <h2>He wants to count his armies</h2> What does it mean to say that Satan stood up against Israel? It means that there was an enemy that came against Israel. Some kind of a threat was posed against Israel, probably another nation. But it incited David to number his army. Well his main general, Joab, objects. He says, ""May the Lord add a hundred times as many as there are!"" His point is that their strength is not in the number of people they have. Their strength is from God.ÿ God is their protector.ÿ To number the people is to say, ""Well, the God-thing is OK, but how strong are we really?"" It was exactly the opposite of the attitude we saw in the first story. David himself knew better. Look at one of his own Psalms (33:16-18). This is why, then, the Lord moves in discipline against David and Israel. At the end of the chapter he sends a plague against them. <h2>I will pay for sacrifice</h2> The story itself is fascinating, but we don't have time to read it all or derive all the lessons that are there. I wanted to focus in on the end of the story for another great attitude David had. It explained his special relationship with God. What happens with the plague is that it is sweeping across Israel. And David actually goes down into the path of the plague as it's spreading, and begins to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. The place he chooses is on the property of this guy named Aruanah. So David is going down to offer a sacrifice in the path of the plague, on Aruanah's property. This is where our story picks upÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is the verse that gets me. ""I will not make an offering that cost me nothing!"" How contrary to our attitude today! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You could imagine in some area of service for the Lord, like giving. We pass a plate here at the end. And you're about to put some cash in, when the guy next to you grabs your arm, ""Let me put this $50 in there for you."" What do you think? ""Hey, a 50's a 50! Besides, mine was just a five!"" And David is saying, ""No way!"" I want to sacrifice for the Lord!"" I think this is a great lesson for us. In a day of ease, convenience, and escapism no one wants to sacrifice anything. And our spiritual lives show it. The Lord is worthy of sacrifice. He's worth the time it takes to study the scriptures. He's worth the hard work of prayer. He's worth rejection. He's worth doing without.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04793.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","People who were Close to God",
"People who were Close to God: Mary: A Common Heroine",1993-03-18,,"  <h1>Possible themes</h1> God's servant: Do whatever you want with me (Luke 1:38). Role reversal: Mary as an example of how God turns things upside down (Luke 1:46-55). <h1>Intro</h1> There are two problems that come up when you talk about Mary. The first is the issue of her being the mother of Christ with no human father. It was a question that Mary herself asked. And the answer to it is in the text. But the second issue that comes up, invariably, stems from the very elevated view of Mary taught by the Catholic church. If you are Catholic, you know that Mary is one of the most venerated saints of all. There have been all kinds of different teachings on her, such as the notion that she continued to be a virgin after she had Jesus. She was sinless. She has a special inroad with her son (so when you pray to her she can intercede for you with Jesus). I don't want to spend a lot of time up here disagreeing with different Catholic teachings because I don't consider it to be that big of a deal. But I will say this, that the authors of the Bible anticipated this kind of reaction. Jesus himself anticipated this kind of reverence. There is a passage in Lukeÿ11:27 where a woman talks about Jesus' mother. Note the response from Jesus, ""On the contrary."" His words are an emphatic correction. He's saying, ""Not at all, ratherÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" It's not that Jesus didn't love his mother. But he's resisting this tendency to venerate her. Men and women in the Bible are portrayed as exactly that?men and women. They have lumps, blemishes, sins, screw-ups of all kinds. And Mary is no exception. She's just a regular person who had the tremendous privilege of being God's servant. Jesus says what's important is someone who hears the word of God and obeys it. That's something we need to keep in mind. <h1>God's servant</h1> That's what we want to turn to right now, the role Mary had as God's servant. <h2>Luke 1:26ff. Gabriel's announcement</h2> The first thing we'll look at is the angel Gabriel's announcement to Mary that she was going to be the mother of the Messiah. Here in Gabriel's announcement is the answer to the question, ""How can a virgin have a baby?"" Very simply, is says, ""nothing is impossible with God."" He could have a baby have a baby. <h2>I am the servant of the Lord (v. 33ff)</h2> Mary goes on to reply, ""I am the servant of the Lordÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Here is what is outstanding about Mary. It's not that she was the mother of Jesus. The outstanding thing about Mary was her attitude. To sum it up, when she knew what God's word was, that was good enough for her. Remember what Jesus said? It's not that she was his mother that made her special. He said, ""Blessed is the one who hears the word of God and obeys it!"" Luke is trying to get a message through to us about Mary: a real follower of Jesus Christ. He drives home the point again in relation to his family in ch.ÿ8ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Alternative answers</h2> Let's think of alternatives: ""You don't understand, my parents are not very understanding of uwanted pregnancy."" ""God, I'm just about to get married! This could ruin the marriage! I could be rejected on account of this type of thing!"" And who would fault her? Would anyone jeopardize their upcoming wedding because God told them to do something? God I?m in school right now and it's really busy. God I'm not strong or brave like a lot of these other peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. God I'm not mature enough to handle this right nowÿ.ÿ.ÿ. It would be very reasonable if Mary had argued or declined altogether. Or at least if she had said, ""I'm going to have to think about this, talk it over with Joseph, etc."" <h2>The results</h2> Just one problem, if Mary had done the very reasonable thing and said, ""This is not the time to be getting pregnant,"" we would not be talking about Mary, mother of Jesus tonight. We'd be talking about ""Rachel"" or whoever. Mary would have slipped into history and obscurity like all the other jewish girls. And here is the point of application for us. Why is it that some people seem to surge ahead in their spiritual growth and begin to really accomplish things for God while others lag behind and sometimes go nowhere? It's because some hear and obey the word of God and some don't. Why do some seem to experience the power of God in their lives. They talk about it as if it's real, you can feel it, etc., while othersÿ are frustrated, ""There's no meat, there's no experience, there's no reality to my Christian life!"" The answer is that some hear and obey the word of God, others don't. Some people have to argue with God. Some people drag their feet and procrastinate. Some put conditions on him. Some pretend they didn't hear. What I want to do is move on in the passage and see a little about why Mary was responsive to God. <h1>The Magnificat (v 46ff.)</h1> This song is calledÿ.ÿ.ÿ. You can see throughout this passage some themes that are going to set the tone for the book of Luke as a whole. One of the strongest is the theme of reversal: That when God is done with human history things will be almost upside-down from what they are now. The humble will be lifted up. The proud will be cut down. The hungry will be fed and the rich will be poor. Connected to this theme is Mary's own view of herself in relation to God. It's at the beginning: <h2>Mary's view of herself</h2> ""He notices little-old-me!"" And then she goes on and says, ""I can't believe this, but I'm going to be the Madona!"" And she's pretty excited about this, understandably. Mary views herself as a small person who is unworthy of the attention of the God of the universe. And this is the first insight into why some hear and do God's word while others don't. Some people believe that they should be noticed by God, and not only that, but that they should be noticed more than others. The idea that God would notice me, or that when he notices me he would be gracious towards me should be a surprise. <h2>Mary's view of God</h2> The second distinctive of Marry's attitude in this passage is her view of God. Her view of herself was . . . But her view of God is that he notices us in order to bless us. He notices us in order to do great things for us. This is so important for us and our theme tonight. Why would someone hear and obey the Lord? Because of this. Much of this book is dedicated to this proposition. God notices us and he wants to do great things for usÿ.ÿ.ÿ. !!!&lt;from here out it's from another version of this teaching&gt; <h1>Christians: Need to hear and obey</h1> This is such a needed emphasis for us, I think. To hear God's word and put it into action is the essence of someone who is serious about God. I just think about our culture, and maybe it was the same in Luke's day. Maybe that's why he was emphasizing this so much. But when I think about our culture, if people are going to follow God it has to feel right. Or we have to be convinced it won't hurt too much. We have to be convinced that it won't be inconvenient. Why is it not enough to simply know it is God's word? <h2>If you're not a Christian</h2> Let me preface that by saying that I do understand if someone is not a Christian yet. When someone is not a Christian, it means that they may not even be convinced that God exists. Or even if they think God exists, they're not convinced of his love for them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: That's why I hate the bumper sticker that says, 'God said it, I believe it, that settles it."" That's a great sentiment, <em>if you're already convinced about God</em>. But what about the person who doesn't even believe God is there?! What about the person who may believe God is there, but he's scared of him? He's seen so many weirdos and flakes who claim to be following God that he says, ""Sounds like a good person to keep your distance from."" These are issues that have to be settled first. Before you can put this kind of trust in God's word, you have to be convinced that he is there and that he loves you. There are a lot of stories of people who learned this about Christ in the book of Luke. There is the woman who was a prostitute, in Luke 7. She could't believe how Christ forgave her and accepted her just as she was. She was so stricken that she wept at Christ's feet. There was the tax-collector/rip-off artist Zaccheaus in Luke 19, who again couldn't believe how Christ accepted him and loved him just the way he was, without changing, without anything. And he was so excited about God's love for him that he wanted to give back everything that he had ever stolen from anyone, and then some. There was person after person who had these joyous encounters with Christ. Because he shattered their expectaion. They expected judgment. They expected someone to frown on them. But instead, Christ said, ""I came to seek you out and forgive you."" There is a whole chapter in Lukeÿ15 about ""lost things"", as Jesus tried to explain his mission and his purpose. He portrayed himself as someone who came to seek and save people (Lukeÿ15:8-10). So, this is the God we are dealing with. He is a God who wants a relationship with us. <h2>With that in viewÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> And it's with that in view that Jesus says hearing and obeying the word of God is the mark of a true disciple. And it does amaze me when Christians, who understand God is a loving God. He is an all-knowing God. And still, it's not enough for them to just hear God's word. It has to be convenient for them. It has to feel right. It can't cost too much. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember as a younger person being exposed to some Christians who took God very seriously. They had Bible studies in their homes. They studied the scriptures. They prayed. They shared with people and gave their time and moneyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. They were serious about following God. I was not. I was convinced that if I got into God, it would mean the end of all my fun. But I knew, if I ever do get into God, it'll be like that. You see some people's spiritual life creeps along at a snail's pace. Nothing much ever changes. They struggle with the same issues year after year and never seem to get very far with them. I think the issue is right here: It's not enough for them to hear God's word and obey. I think of someone like Mary here. She was a nobody. She knew she was a nobody. In the ensuing verses she expresses her amazement at how God selected her for one of the most important tasks in history. You could easily picture her, or one of us, saying, ""That just sounds like too much. It's going to alienate my family. My fiance won't understandÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" She would have continued on in relative obscurity. That's what a lot of people are doing with their lives. They're fritering time and their lives away because every little move they make they have to be convinced all over again that ""yes, God's way is best. No, the other ways are dead-ends.""ÿ They might drag on for months about each little issue. By the same token,ÿ there are people who rocket along in their spiritual growth.ÿ They seem to change so fast.ÿ They seem to have success at things.ÿ And I really do see the difference as how responsive someone is to God.ÿ Whether it's enough for them to know God's word on something, or whether they need to go through the school of hard knocks each and every time they make progress. Veryÿ practically speaking, I'm talking about finding outÿ that you need to forgive someone and instead of saying, ""He makes me angry though!""ÿ You say,ÿ ""Alright, this is going to be toughÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" When you find out that studying the scriptures, not, ""But I""m not a studying type of personÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" When you find out that God wantsÿ you toÿ share Christ with people, not, ""But it scares me!ÿ I don't think I can do that!""ÿ But, ""It scares me,ÿ but I'd better do that!"" It comes down to those kinds of choices.ÿ Those choices are the difference between people who are really getting close to God and growing and those who are kind of languishing. I'll conclude with the thought that there is probably an issue in your life right now that God is trying to speak to you on. He's trying to make his word known to you.ÿ And if you have Mary's reaction, you're going to surge forward in your spiritual growth.ÿ If you have another reaction,ÿ you're going to stall out.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04794.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","People who were Close to God",
"People Who were Close to God: Barnabas: Growth over a Lifetime with God",1993-03-25,,"  Barnabas <h1>Intro: Who is Barnabas?</h1> We wanted to talk about Barnabas tonight because he is a guy who's life really amounted to something. And the great thing about Barnabas is that he was with the Lord for a long time. Lots of things happened over that long history with God. This is such a great message for us today, because there is so much cynicism about meaning in life. We live in the most materialistic culture in the whole world. And in a culture as materialistic as ours, it's just a given that you live for money. You live to accumulate goods, live comfortable. And the failure of things like marriage and love undermine even those ideals as something to live for. So I think there is a high degree of cynicism in our culture. I want to look at someone like Barnabas, because he really amounted to something. And the great thing is that the way he got there is a path that is available to anyone and everyone. <h1>The intermediate stage: Barnabas as a trusted worker in the church</h1> Where I want to start is kind of in the middle of Barnabas' life. This is after he had been a Christian about 10 years or more. <h2>Antioch</h2> The setting of this passage is the new and spontaneous church at Antioch. It had sprouted up more or less spontaneously and was growing very fast. And the mother church at Jerusalem, which is where Barnabas was from, wanted to send someone up there to check it out. It's clear that Luke is trying to tell us the good news that the message of Christ is spreading. And the fact that all these people are believing is so great. But he is also saying something here about Barnabas. ""He was a good man, full of the Spiritÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" And he says that when Barnabas arrived on the scene, two things happened. First of all, people were encouraged to give their whole hearts to the Lord. Second, many more people came to Christ. <h2>Encouraging people to give their whole hearts</h2> Especially the first of these?encouraging people to give their whole hearts to God?that is very unusual. That a hard thing to do. When you think about giving your whole heart to God, what kind of reaction to people have? ""Whoa! That scares me!"" What's God going to do with me? What does it take to help someone over those fears? It takes a very powerful example. It takes someone who is that way himself, and yet is very attractive. Their life is very attractive, and what God has done with them is very attractive. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've met some people who have really given their life to the Lord and had an opportunity to interact with them. I think of some of the missionaries I've met, or just some of the older Christians I have known. And there is something very attractive. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember as an 18 year old going with Mark Batcheck to hang out with these older missionariesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Mark had been really struggling with his Christian walk up to that pointÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But when he walked away that night?ÿ ""I'm going to become a missionary!""ÿ You have to understand, this guy stood to inheritÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I want to be this kind of person. I fear that sometimes people can come in contact with me and they are no more likely to desire God than before. But I have experienced the opposite. I have experienced times when I could be around others and they wanted to get closer to God from seeing my example. And it's real gratifying. I just think this is a sign of some real genuineness. A motivational speaker can get you excited about something for a couple days. A new idea can get you excited for a week. But this is a profound effect?persuading someone to turn over their life to God. <h2>Full of the Spiritÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> So, Luke concludes that Barnabas was a good manÿ.ÿ.ÿ. To say that he was full of the Spirit is to say that he was spiritually powerful. And to say that he had faith is to say that he was close to God. And finally, as a result of Barnabas' input, many more were brought to the Lord. <h1>Where did he come from?</h1> Well, I wouldn't mind at all being described this way. I mean, when you think of the way people remember you, how do you want it to be? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: He built this great house in the suburbs! And his golf game wasn't too bad either! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: She had the best hairdos for most of her life! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: He could drink beer all night! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: She always drove new cars! The fact is, no one would remember you for that kind of stuff. But those are the kinds of things that take our time and energy. What Barnabas was accomplishing with his life was really worth living for. And it gets better. We'll see in a moment. <h2>Acts 4:34-37</h2> But first, to look at his roots, in Acts 4ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This passage tells us a couple things about Barnabas. For one, it tells us that his name wasn't really Barnabas. It was Joseph. And the reason he was called Barnabas was that he was encouraging to people. This is great. It's great because encouragement, in the biblical sense, is so good. To say that Barnabas encouraged people is to say that he was a real motivator. That's what encouragement is. It's not, ''You look nice today."" That's good. It's positive. But encouragement is so much more than that. When you encourage someone in the biblical sense, it means that you motivate them. You motivate them to action. You motivate them to change an attitude. You motivate them to keep going. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When someone tells you you're good at something, you know the effect it has on you. It makes you want to excell at it. I remember when I was considering a career in carpentry, and someone took me aside and said that they saw in me a great ability to work with people. Had I considered going in that direction? And that word of encouragement changed the whole direction of my life. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I sat down with a guy on my porch and started pointing out what a great effect he'd been having lately on people. He turned to me and said, ""You don't know how much I've been thinking of just quitting things lately.ÿ I've been so depressed, feeling like I don't make a difference to anyone. If words of encouragement were going on regularly, we would be in a very motivated, dynamic group. <h2>Everyone can do it</h2> The great thing about encouragement is that everyone can do it. This was one of the first ways of serving that Barnabas got into. It was one of the first ways for me too. All it takes is thinking about someone. When I set my mind to encourage someone, I think about that person. I try to think about him in a prayerful way, if you know what that means. That means that you kind of think through things with the Lord. You pray about the person. You think of what you have seen lately. You think of how that person has effected you. And I'll guarentee you will get some insight on that person, from God, which will encourage. Oh, the other part of it is that you have to say something. I don't know how many times I've gotten something in my mind that I know I'm supposed to tell someone, and I forget. And then maybe it never happens. I believe I've really let someone down when that happens. So you have to speak up. <h2>He gave</h2> The other thing we see about Barnabas is that he gave.ÿ He sold some property and gave the proceeds to benefit the needy. Here again, this is something everyone can do. I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but the majority of time when givingÿ is discussed in the Bible, it is not discussed as something you do because people need it.ÿ It is something you do to become more of a sacrificialÿ person. Giving can be of your money, timeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>A promoter of others (Acts 11:25</h2> One other thing I want to observe about Barny's earlier life and ministry is that he was a promoter of others.ÿ We always find this guy promoting other people.ÿ I'mÿ sureÿ this was connected to the fact that he was an encourager.ÿ But what I mean by promotingÿ others is that he thought of ways he could get behind other people's ministry.ÿ He thought of ways he could push other people ahead.ÿ He did it with the apostles at Jerusalem.ÿ He did it with Paul.ÿ Later we find him doing it with a guy named Mark. Barny himself later becameÿ kind of a big cheese.ÿÿ But long before that, he was constanlty trying to promote other people ahead of himself. <h1>Later life: Worldwide impact</h1> Later in Acts, starting in ch. 13, Barnabas is chosen by God to beome a worldwide church planter with Paul the apostle.ÿ Even after he parts ways with Paul in ch. 14, he continues on planting churches and having a worldwide impact. Let's put it this way, when Barnabas' life was over, a lot of people were grateful that he chose to go with the Lord. I want to conclude with a few observations. <h2>Never set your goals too low</h2> First of all, don't make the mistake of thinking too small about what God can do with you.ÿ Who could have told, way back at the beginning ofÿ Barnabas' Christian life, that he was going to do all the stuff he did?ÿ Who can tell about you? I'm glad that Barny didn't just say, ""Well, I can give of my money and that's about all."" <h2>Maturity takes decades</h2> Secondly, the story of Barny's lifeÿ covered decades.ÿÿ He didn't stumble into all this usefulness at once.ÿÿ It took a lot of time. I think people need to realize this about their Christian growth.ÿ It takes a long time, but as you can see the effectsÿ can be very dramatic. <h2>Do the things you can do now</h2> A lot people say, ""If I can't be a teacher then I don't know what I want to do.""ÿ Or they don'tÿ know where to start in their service.ÿÿ Here were a few excellent tips from Barny's life. If you do the things you can right now, the Lord will open upÿ more opportunities for.ÿ There is no doubt about that at allÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04795.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","People who were Close to God",
"Colossians 2: Answers to Questions",1994-05-26,,"  <h1>(Buck) Intro: The kinds of questions we're talking about areÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> (video of adds and things) That video was one Michelle ran accross in one of her classes. And the reason we showed it here is that we're talking tonight about our culture, and where we turn for answers in our culture. Answers to the questions of life, like: What is the meaning to my life? What does God want from me? Who is God and what is he like? What about life after death? How do I fix the problems of my life? Why are things so screwed up? I believe that most of us turn to popular opinion for these kinds of answers. Opinions reflected in our music, our television, and various other forms of communication. These opinions have tremendous sway with us. And since our culture is so diverse, you can find an answer that feels right to you just about anywhere. Which is another point of this video: a very popular notion today is that however you answer these questions, whatever you believe is OK. We are a multi-cutural, diverse society. And so, part of adapting to that reality is to hold that whatever your answers are, they're good as long as they work for you. You look within yourself. You look to the popular culture. And whatever answer you come up with is OK, as long as it works for you. This approach has always been popular. It was something the Colossians were getting into, which Paul addresses in Col. 2. We're going to have Michelle explain the passage for us. <h1>Contrast the source(s) of answers</h1> <h2>(Michelle) Explain the passage</h2> Paul is worried (vv. 1) Because they are being tempted to turn elsewhere for answers (vv. 4, 8) Christ is the source of all our answers (vv. 6-8) <h2>(Buck) We do the same as the Colossians</h2> Like I said, there is a lot of similarity between ourselves and the Colossians here. Paul is saying that God alone has the answer to life's questions; we say they can be found elsewhere. Let's consider how we answer some of these questions. Like morality. How do we answer a question like the morality of homosexuality? Like meaning in life: majority opinion. Like spiritual questions about God and the afterlife: What feels right to you. These are the same sources the Colossians were turning toÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Essentially human sources, whether ourselves or the culture around us. Now Michelle's going to talk about this controversial position that God alone has the answers. <h2>(Mich.) God says, ""Only I have answers""</h2> God says humans have insight, creativity, no shortage of brilliant answers (v.ÿ4). The problem is all our answers are tainted by sinÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>Contrast types of answers</h1> Now we'll consider how this works out practically by considering some of the answers the Colossians were getting, and some that we are arriving at. We need to look at how sin affects our perspective. <h2>(Mich.) What is the meaning of life</h2> Emphasize here how the answer we arrive at have the appearance of wisdom. They're very persuasive. <h2>(Buck) How to get right with God</h2> I just want to conclude with some thoughts about relating to God. Because of all the areas that we should look to God for guidance, how to relate to him would be the most important. Let's just think for a moment about how any one of us would relate to God if we were going to figure it out by ourselves. And as I think about that, the first feeling I get is one of fear, or inadequacy, or guilt. Because we're talking about God. Who knows what he's like? Because one of the main reasons we conceive of God is because we are compelled to look for a source of things. And any thing or anybody who could be the source of the universe would just be incomprehensible! Who knows if he would even pay attention to me? And if he did pay attention, would it be good? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember liking being a student here at OSU because you could be anonymous in classes of 200 other peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's never heard anything about how to relate to God. What would you do? Here are some of my thoughts. See if they are similar to your own. 1) Try to get his attention. I think the first thing I'd do is try to get his attention. Since I'm not sure how to do this, I'll make something up. And I think it would be a ritual. Some kind of ritual that would show I'm really sincere, like saying the same thing over and over again. Or maybe I would go to some special place where he'd be more likely to hear me. But somehow I've got to get his attention because I'm not sure he would even hear me. 2) Try to appease him. The second thing that comes to my mind is I've got to appease him somehow. I know I'm guilty. I know I feel guilty. So I've got to somehow show that I'm really, really sorry. 3) Make a vow of things I'll do for him. Then, finally, when I think of relating to God, I think I should make a vow of some kind. ""God, I'll try and do better. Show me what you want, and I'll try and do it."" These are the things that come to my mind. Are they the things you think about? I'm not sure. I also thought about asking him to show me some kind of trick or something to affirm that he heard me. All these tendencies can be seen in the practices of all religion, which shows me I'm not all that unusual. We see people doing rituals to get God's attention. We see people doing penetence of some kind to show God that they are truly sorry. We see people coming up with rules for a godly lifestyle that will ensure God's favor. And yet, the amazing thing is, in every area, as we see God reveal himself in the Bible, he tells us exactly the opposite! When it comes to hearing us, God assures us that he hears and is interested in every single thing we think, do, or say (Psa. 139:7ff.; Luke 12:6, 7; I Peterÿ5:7). He already has his ear attentive to us. He already knows more about you than you know about yourself. He is already eager to hear from you! When it comes to doing something to appease him, he tells us there is nothing we can do. Jesus communicated this in his unique way by absurdity. He said, ""I'll tell you how to handle your guilt problem with Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" In Matt.ÿ5:29, 30ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In my mind it's great to picture him explaining this to people in all seriousness. And the reason is that he was talking to people were were intensely religious. When it comes to appeasing God and doing things to show you're sorry, the audience Jesus was addressing was the model. But Jesus is trying to drive home the point that you can't. You can't appease God by some ritual, or some observance, or some vow. The whole reason Jesus came was to make peace with God for us. Because we can't do it ourselves, he came to make peace with God for us. He did this by dying on the cross for us, paying the price for sin with his death. As it says in Rom.ÿ5:1ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The same is true about vows, rules, trying to live a righteous lifestyle. Paul says in Gal.ÿ2:21ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Now, what I have described, God's plan for how we relate to him, is exactly the opposite of what any one of us would have come up with if left to ourselves. Instead of having to get the attention of the distant, uncaring God, we have his attention all the time. Instead of having to dance a jig and make promises that we'll never be bad again, God says, ""I just want to forgive you, plain and simple."" The way we come into a relationship with God is by simply asking, ""God, I would like your forgiveness. And yes, I want a relationship with you."" Now to me, this particular aspect of the Bible's teaching has the ring of truth to it. Because I feel very strongly that no human would have made this up. If it were up to us, we would like to show God that we are worthy somehow. We would like to earn our way into his favor. And we would make up some way to be good enough for God. What makes the message of the Bible so unique is that God says there is no way to come to him on our own. We need to simply receive the forgiveness he has already purchased for us.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05356.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 2002 - Buck McCallum",

"Hebrews 3: Hypocrisy Hardens Your Heart",1993-04-08,," I want to start by looking at this verse, because it is the point of the whole chapter. It is the point that the author is driving towards. And it may be one of the most interesting verses in the whole Bible, from the standpoint of applicability. First of all, it tells us that it is possible to harden your heart. And that hardening comes about because of sin, specifically the deceitful nature of sin. The examples we used in the skit tonight (alcoholism and obsession with self/body) are a couple of the most obvious types of sin that people are blind and self-deceived about. But the same is true about all kinds of issues. And third, it tells us that we can do something about it, encourage each other. I want to talk about all these things. But first I want to talk about the background of this comment. Because the author is referring to the hard-heartedness of the Jewish people, during a certain period in the OT. <h1>Bring our Biblesÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> (Put up joke overhead) Most of you wouldn't know if this was in the Bible or not because you don't have one hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Let's encourage each other to stop this trend of Bible-less Bible-studies. <h1>The people didn't believe God</h1> Let's go back in the text a little and get a context for the verse we want to talk about. We'll start in v.ÿ7 You can see he's talking about a period here where the nation of Israel put God to the test. I don't want to assume that you are all experts on Bible history, or even that you know anything about it at all. What the author is talking about is the time in history when God brought the nation of Israel out of slavery in Egypt. (refer to movie on last sunday) And he's saying about these people, ""The problem with them was that they constantly tested and tried me; they rebelled and they had hardened hearts."" And God's very upset about these people. As he says here, ""I swore they would never enter my rest!"" His ""rest"" was the promised land. He had delivered them from slavery in Egypt so that they could go to a promised land, the land of Israel. And God said, ""You guys are so bad, you're not going to enjoy that land."" He caused them to wonder in the wilderness for 40 years, until an entire generation of people died, and their children were the ones who got to go into the promised land. It's really a pretty amazing story. But what we want to do is summarize. What was it about these people that the author wants to warn us about? <h2>Examples of the problem</h2> It might help us to look at a couple examples of what it was that God was angry about. <h2>Exodus 17:1-7</h2> This is one of the first (read text) This story seems reasonable enough on the face of it. Some people are out in the desert, and they're thirst! So they whine about it a little. But in the context, it's a little more outrageous. These people had just been witness to the most amazing series of miracles the world had ever seen, and probably will ever see. It was the series of miraculous events that inspired the movie. God had sent plagues on Egypt. He had parted a sea and let the people walk through on dry land. God had brought these people out into this wilderness miraculously. And then they have the nerve to wonder, ""Is the Lord among us? Is he going to take care of us?"" And this was just the first of many incidents like this. It was constant. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You see Moses called this place ""Meribah,"" which means a place of struggle or contention. And by the time it was all said and done, Moses named about a dozen places Meribah. <h2>What was at the heart of it?</h2> But what was at the heart of their whining and ingratitude? What was at the heart of their accusation? It was unbelief. They didn't believe that God was going to take care of them. They started to accuse God and Moses because they didn't believe God would be faithful to them. This is what the author of Hebrews said too. He said they had a heart of unbelief towards God (read v.ÿ12 again). They grumbled. They were accusing. They were rebellious, as the author described it earliere. But at the heart of it all, they were unbelieving. They didn't believe God would take care of them. This is a really important insight about sin in general. We've talked about it in here before. Sin is when we don't believe God. You can take any sin you want, at the the bottom of it there's a heart of unbelief. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's take a very external, obvious sin like drug use. Why would someone use drugs and destroy their mind and body? Because they don't believe God's ways of making us happy will work. Like the drunk, why does he need the liquor? Because real life, the life God has for us, is not good enough. He needs something else. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Why do people abuse sex in a sinful way? Because they don't believe God's way, commited sex in a marriage relationship, will work or is fun enough, or whatever. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Why do we indulge the sins of laziness, insecurity, self-centeredness, or whatever? With any sin, there's something we're not believing with God. There's a great morsel for you to take home with you tonight. Think about the issues you struggle with and ask, ""What is it that I'm not believing?"" <h2>Repeated sin hardens your heart</h2> But now, here's the insight that we want to focus in on: repeated sin in an area (repeated unbelief), hardens your heart. Like I told you with these people, their whining at Meribah was just the first of countless grumblings. They could never get it through their heads that God was going to take care of them. And pretty soon, it just became their way of dealing with anything and everything. It didn't matter what it was?they could be out of water, food, in a difficult situation?their first reaction was to accuse Moses and God of letting them down. ""Why have you brought us out here to the wilderness to die!?"" It became a way of life for them. ""What do you do when you're worried? Let's go accuse Moses! What do you do if you need something? Let's go grumble against God!"" They did it about everything. And the author's point here is, their heart was hardened. By their repeated lifestyle of unbelief, they hardened their own hearts. <h1>What is a hardened heart?</h1> Let's think about this hardened heart thing. What is a hardened heart? A hard heart has to do with your relationship with God. When you have a hard heart, it means that God can't get through to you anymore. It means that you're so effective at resisting God, that God can't get you to hear him anymore. These people just got it in their mind that God wasn't going to take care of them, and so they considered it their divine right to grumble and accuse. And God could never persuade them on that point. It didn't matter if he provided for them every day they were out there in the desert for 40 years. They still thought he would let them down. <h2>Can happen in salvation</h2> This can happen to non-Christians. The Bible tells us that God is knocking on the door of our hearts. God is seeking us out. (show Rev.ÿ3:20) God's posture towards us is aggressive. He wants a relationship with us. He wants to forgive us. But the problem is that we can say, ""I don't believe I need that."" Or, ""If I turn to God, I'm afraid he'll let me down. It'll hurt me somehow."" And we can harden our hearts towards God. We can say, 'I don't need God in my life,"" ""I don't need his forgivenes,"" and so on until we really start to believe it. And then what? How is God going to break through that? <h2>With sins</h2> We can do the same thing with other sins, even after we're Christians. We can harden our hearts about a sin like laziness. We can get the sense that God wants us to work on it. We can get the sense that something is wrong. But we don't believe God, that he can deliver us from that kind of sin. And we harden our hearts by saying things like, ""That's just the way I am. I've always been that way. I can't change, I've tried."" What's God supposed to do when we shut him out with those kinds of lies? <h2>Sin is decietful</h2> If we look back at the passage we started with, we see something about sin. He says, ""It's deceitful."" Isn't that the truth! When I think back on my life, and the issues I've really gotten hung up on, it's been because sin is so deceitful. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I think about one period where I was alienating all kinds of people in my life because I was so mean. And what do you think I said to myself? ""Yeah, that's right I'm mean! And I'm gonna stay that way till you weaklings get used to it!"" Not at all. First I tried to say to myself that I'm not mean.. ""The problem is the people I'm hanging around."" But that didn't work for long. Then I tried to say, 'I can't help it! I'm tring and I just can't help it!"" And that wasn't true at all. Just like all the lies we tell ourselves to keep from having to deal with things. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I think of the times in my life when I've had very using, very self-centered relationships with girls. Did I say to myself, ""Allright, I'm going to go out and use some women hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Not at all! I said, ""I need to feel good right now. She can help me."" Or I said, ""She wants me to do this."" We have beautiful ways of disguising the truth. Haven't we all seen people who move from relationship to relationship, using the other person sexually and in every other way. And then they move on. And what do they say? ""I'm just into love."" Wrong! So sin is deceitful. And given enough time, it hardens your heart. God works on us and he tries to get our attention. But what can he do after a while? <h1>Encourage one another</h1> Well, there was one more insight that we got from this text. And that is, there is something we can do about it. As it says, ""Encourage each other daily."" Peoplel wonder, ""Why do I need to be involved in regular fellowship with other Christians?"" Here's your answer. Because we need that regular input from others that the author calls ""encouragement."" Encouragement is when you notice something about someone. And you say something about it. You speak up. We talked about it with Barnabas a couple weeks ago. He was called the ""Son of encouragement."" You see in the context here what encouragement is all about? Helping people with their weaknesses, helping people with their sins. It's giving them a vision, ""Hey, there is a way out. God can help you with that."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember getting caught up in the sin of self-pity, which is something I can really get into sometimes. I remember one of my friends seeing me nursing all my sorrows (It would have been easy to avoid it, to rebuke meÿ.ÿ.ÿ.). And it was true that I had beenin a lot of failure. He spoke up and said, ""I think God has you here because you're ready for it. And he wants to teach you how to handle this situation."" He gave me a vision of how God could help me change. And we need that. We deceive ourselves. And we get stuck in ruts. And we get habbits. And we can feel so helpless about things. We need others in our lives to show us how we can change. It's scary, because it means letting people see your weaknesses, or your discouragement, etc. That's why you can be involved in fellowship and not really be involved with people. You can hide yourself from people. <h1>Todayÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> Just one more thing I might add, the author keeps driving home the point of ""todayÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" That's becasue some o f these decisions really shouldn't be put off. That includes the decision to become a Christianÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The easiest thing to do with some tough decisions is to say, ""I'll think about it."" That's hardening your heart.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04841.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Hebrews - Buck McCallum",

"Apologetics - the 'Offensive' Beliefs of Christianity - Biblical Creation and Evolution",1993-07-03,,"  <h1>Intro: Evolution is an emotional issue</h1> Tonight we're going to compare two views on the origin of the world as we see it: Creation and evolution. If you've been involved in the debate about this issue at all, then you know that it is a very emotional issue. It has been that way ever since the turn of the century when evolution began to become popular. It's emotional from the Christian side of things because the conflict between creationism and evolution defined modern American Christianity so much. It was a conflict that put Christians on the defensive and began to make them feel like they were a small backwater, a minority in a culture that was against them. Some people who believed in evolution made Christians out to be ignorant, unscientific hillbillies. On the other side, it is an emotional issue for people who believe in evolution. It's emotional because sometimes creationists say things that are really stupid. So when you hear something like the moon is made out of cheese, your response is often fierce and emotional. But they are also emotional because there is a lot at stake. To say that creation took place is to say that a personal, creative God exists. And a god like that is the kind of God you would have to meet some day. It would be the kind of God you would be accountable to. And don't think for a minute that weighty issues like that don't play a part. It's naive to think that in the face of stakes that high?the question of ultimate reality and whether we will ever face God?people are completely objective and unbiased. It is an emotional issue. So, one of the side effects of that is that we find people taking positions and making statements that are on the extremes. What I want to do tonight is look only at those positions in each camp that are more solid, definsible, etc. In other words, I want to take the most well-supported and verifiable claims of each position and see how they compare. <h1>Clarifying the problem(s)</h1> When we talk about ""Creationism,"" we are going to be talking about the way it is presented in the Bible. That means you need to take some of the things you've heard, or a very 2-dimensional, simplistic portrayal of Creationism and put it aside for now. I want to look specifically at what is stated in the Bible. With evolution, likewise, we're going to talk about some of the different ways that term is understood and used. There are two distinct problems when we start to compare Genesis with the geological and biological evidence we have. On the one hand, there is the problem of the earth's age. And that has to do with the geological evidence that we live on a very old planet, which some see as not allowable by the biblical account. The second issue has to do with the matter of evolution, and whether the story of creation and God's intervention is at odds with what we know about evolution. I will deal with each of these questions in turn. But first, let's actually read the Bible's account of creation. <strong>Read the passage</strong> <h1>Creation and Evolution</h1> I want to deal with the issue of evolution first, because in a lot of ways, it is the one that people want to know about the most. <h2>What the Bible affirms</h2> What does this passage actually affirm that would have a bearing on the matter of evolution? Well, it says three things. 1. God created all things. That is certainly what is affirmed outright in v.ÿ1. But it is also described throughout the rest of this passage. 2. The animals and plants he created were ""after their kind."" This is a statement that has been taken to have quite a bit of bearing on the whole issue of creation and evolution. It is argued by some creationists that the phrase ""after their kind,"" which is repeated about half a dozen times, disallows evolution. 3. He created man distinct from the rest, in his own image. Then, finally, the pinacle of creation was humankind. And the point that this passage makes is that man was unique. These are the ""facts"", if you will, from the Bible's side of things. In other words, these are the things that Gen.ÿ1 clearly affirms, that would have something to do with the issue of evolution (The ""6 days"" issue has to do more with the age of the earth. We will also talk about the interpretation of that language at that time). What do we know from the scientific side? <h2>What science affirms</h2> We can say quite a few things from the scientific side of things. 1. Evolution is a fact. This is somewhat of a surprise to many Christians and religious types. A lot of the rhetoric that goes back and forth between the two camps tends to emphasize that evolution is a theory. And indeed, if you are talking about <em>naturalistic evolution</em>--that is, evolution with no God in the picture, evolution as a self-contained, self-governing system--that is a theory. And we'll talk about that in a minute. But the fact is, evolution happens every day. Species do mutate. (show examples of horse, elephant and car on overhead). And there are examples from today (peppered moth in England). Organisms do adapt to their environment, resulting in some degree of selection, although it's not nearly so orderly or understandable as Darwin first thought. Now, even though I say evolution is a fact, this does not mean that every single species, genus or phylum has come from one original source. That most certainly cannot be demonstrated as a fact in any sense of the word. So, we know that a process called evolution occurs. Just how far it extends is something that is open to great debate, and I suspect always will be. And that's simply because the data we need to close the issue is probably not recoverable. 2. There is an observable progression in the geological record. In the geological record, we don't find all living things appearing at once, as if God entered in and created the world in 7 days. What we find is a very slow progression from very simple celled planktons and algeas, to sophisticated reptiles and mammals. 3. The progression was not uniform. When I say that there was a gradual progression from simple to complex life forms, I do not mean that it was a nice, smooth process. In fact, the evidence is quite clear that the entrance of life forms in the geological record was quite abrupt and proliferate. In other words, a new life form appears in the geological record with gusto. It won't be there at one point, and then it's all over the world in great numbers. At the very least, the conclusion we have to reach is that something dramatic happened at these epochs to cause often the extinction of many species and the abrupt introduction of many new ones. There is a fascinating article on this in the <em>National Geographic</em> (May, 1989). <h2>Resolving the two</h2> Well, when we look at things this way, I really don't think these two perspectives are all too far apart. <h3>Observation of processes does not explain them.</h3> First, this is real important, the observation of a process does not explain why that process happens. There is a distinction we need to make in scientific research between the behavior of a process, and what governs that behavior. The role of science is to establish, by research and observation, the regular patterns of behavior of a process. And when that can be established, we can call it a law, or a theory, or whatever. But that does not mean that is the end of it. We have not said anything about what governs that process. We cannot say something about why that process happens or where it came from. Here's the point: There has never been a process, or an object, or a fact unearthed by science that is a stand-alone, self contained process. In other words, every thing, every process, every object is contingent upon something else. Every process has a cause. We have never discovered an ultimate cause. Every process has other forces which govern it. We have never discovered the ultimate force that governs the universe. For a scientist to trace down the working of various processes is great. It could conceivably be an endless task. On the other hand, to draw conclusions about the ultimate source of those processes, or the ultimate force that governs those processes is not legitimate! That's to go beyond what a scientist can scientifically verify. He can speculate if he wants. But at that point he's talking about his philosiphy or his belief. Science addresses questions in the natural world. To speculate on the existence of a <em>super</em>natural sources, or the <em>lack of</em> a supernatural source, is not in the scope of science. That is a philosophical or religious question. I want you to understand this boundary here, because it is by crossing it that the debate has really heated up. Many naturalistic evolutionists will go beyond the legitimate scope of science and begin to draw conclusions on the supernatural dimension. And I think that's part of what heats up the dialogue. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Read example of Asimov from <em>Science Held Hostage</em>, p.ÿ131. For one thing, there is not ""consistent picture"" science has painted on the matter of randomness. But secondly, you see how he has elevated these ""laws"" to the level of deity? His assumption here seems to be that once we observe a process, like gravity, then no more explanation is necessary, which is simply untrue. Like I said before, scientific observations of processes like gravity further the mysteries. We realize there is something beyond these laws upon which even they depend. <h3>Therefore science and the Bible compliment one another.</h3> This is why it is that the statements, ""Evolution is a fact,"" and ""God created all living things,"" are not contradictions. In fact, they they are complimentary. They explain one another. As Christians, we believe that God created a universe of such energy and diversity and adaptability, that such a process as evolution could take place! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In the Christian view, you could almost picture God as a gardner, who takes a lot of pleasure in his garden. So, he has planted a number of things. And, in the Christian view, he still tends the garden. But there are also numerous things happening all the time that can be explained without the direct intervention of the gardner. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Jesus said in Matt.ÿ5:45 that God causes the sun to shine on the righteous and the wicked, and he causes the rain to fall without partiality. Well, in fact we know today that there are natural processes involved in all that. And they have been well-documented. But that does not mean God is not involved! And the biblical position is that God, as the founder and maintainer of all things, can be refered to as the one who makes things happen, and yet we acknowledge that the means he uses to do these things are natural processes. <h3>""After their kind"" is a general statement</h3> Secondly, we need to realize that the refrain ""after their kind"" is a very general statement. Some people take this to mean that the different animals and plants reproduce after their kind. So they conclude Genesisÿ1 means you cannot have evolution between species or something. But, it just doesn't say ""species"", does it? It is possible that this statement is saying something about how animals and plants give rise to similar animals and plants. And remember, there is quite a bit of evidence to say that periodically new families were introduced into creation. So, this very well could be the hand of God. I'll state my personal position at this point. And that is that God has intervened on occassion and ""planted"" (to go back to the gardner metaphor) new types of plants and animals. And they, in turn, multiplied into diverse forms. But, there's something else we need to understand about this statement. And that is, it has theologically important motives. The author is trying to set up a contrast in the course of this narrative. On the one hand, animals, birds, fish, and everything reproduces after its kind. And this is repeated again and again to drive the point home. But then, God creates man. And he creates man, not after his kind, but in the image of God! What this means is that all of creation is on one level, and man is on another. We are distinct from the rest of creation in that we carry the image of God. Later in ch.ÿ2, the image of God is described as receiving God's Spirit. It probably has to do with personalness, etc. Here's the point: No matter what evolved or didn't evolve, mankind as he is now, required the direct intervention of God. Because a spiritual dimension doesn't evolve. Personalness doesn't evolve. Love doesn't evolve. The way we are now, according to the Bible, is the result of God's intervention. <h2>Conclusion</h2> What I'm saying here is that when you distill what you can actually say for sure from both the Bible and science, there aren't real problems on the matter of evolution. The Bible allows for processes to be present in the world, and yet say that God is behind them. Most of the debate is from careless people who over-extend what either the Bible or science can affirm, and then inflate the rhetoricÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>The earth's age</h1> Secondly, I want to turn to a related issue, the matter of the earth's age. First, we need to clarify the problem. <h2>Bishop Usher</h2> If you go to OSU, or you read any popular book on geology, then the first person who comes up in connection with the creation account is who? Bishop Usher.ÿ.ÿ. And the date he came up with was that the creation occured 4036 years before Christ. In fact, later the principal of Cambridge University, later refined this to the week of Oct.ÿ16, 4004 B.C. And this is thrown in your face, ""Well, this is the Christian view! Now we can go on to the scientific viewÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" (By the way, this kind of speculation was right in line with the understanding of the day! That was the level of their understanding, what can we say? I certainly wouldn't want science and all scientists to be ridiculed because early biologists speculated flies spontaneously generated out of meat!) In fact, I don't agree with Bishop Usher. And I don't know anyone who does! No matter how you slice it, his calculations were wrong.ÿ.ÿ. Missing generations, etc.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Creation Research</h2> Nevertheless, the geneologies can only be stretched so far. So some try to bring the geological record into line with their reading of the biblical record. They try to support the view that we are living in a very young earth. One group that has done the most thorough job of this is the Creation Research Foundation. These are the people who have founded the whole movement known as ""Scientific Creationism."" I told you that some naturalistic scientists have over-stepped their bounds and used science to draw conclusions about the supernatural or spiritual dimension. The error that these people make is much the same. They bring their beliefs into the realm of scientific enquiry, and unfortunately, seem to be willing to do just about anything to make the data fit their beliefs. You will hear that the sediment layers of the Grand Canyon were deposited in a few days because of Noah's flood. (Of course, those are not the only type of sedimentation. There are living forms of sedimentation, such as barrier reefs and carbonate platforms. The layers of sedimentation here depend on seasonal growing cycles. In other words, a layer of organisms needs to grow, flourish and die before you deposit one layer. And some of these carbonate platforms [e.g. the Bahama Banks] extend 10 k. deep! They are so deep that they cause the oceanic crusts to bend and warp to support them. [source:<em> Earth and Life Through Time </em>by Steven Stanley. W. H. Freeman &amp; Co. 1986, p. 96]) You will hear that stars were created with their light-beams in placeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Well, the point is, I can't identify with this particular group of folks. And I find it most unfortunate that they're so vocal. Because when people think of the Christian view of the earth's age, they refer to these folks. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I watched a NOVA special on this last winter, and the entire Christian point of view was taken up with these folks. What a shame, is all I can say. Suggest book, <em>Science Held Hostage</em>. <h1>Interpreting Gen. 1</h1> Let me just conclude here by showing you how I understand Gen.ÿ1. <h2>The ""Days"" are certainly not 24-hr. periods</h2> First of all, we need to realize that the term ""day"" here is used quite loosely, much like we use the same term. We use the term in different ways ourselves--sometimes refering to ""day-light,"" sometimes an epic, like ""day of the horse and buggy."" I want you to realize that interpreters have recognized this for centuries. And one reason is the evidence to support it right in the passage. It is obvious that a great deal of flexibility is being used with the term ""day"" because in ch.2 we have a recap of some of the events of the 6th day. And if you read ch.2 you'll see that quite a bit of time elapsed on this ""day"". <h2>""The heavens and earth""</h2> First of all, we need to realize that the term, ""heavens and earth is a very common couplet which refers to ""everything."" In essence, verse one says, ""God created everything."" So, contrary to some people's understanding of Genesisÿ1, the whole thing has already been created by the time vs.ÿ1 is over! People in their interpretation don't really come to terms with this fact. I can't tell you how frequently this couplet is used to describe everything that is--literally dozens of times throughout both the Pentateuch and the OT as a whole. So, the whole world is created in v.ÿ1. Then, the attention shifts to the ""earth"" in v.ÿ2. Now the term ""earth"" is the Hebrew term `<em>erets</em>. And it is translated ""earth"" here, but throughout the rest of the Pentateuch, it is translated ""land."" <h3>The perspective of the people</h3> Now, we need to refresh ourselves on the perspective of these people. Where were they? They were in the wilderness, waiting for God to give them <em>the land</em>. But, what's more, in the course of Genesis, the term `<em>erets</em>, ""land,"" is used many many times to refer to the land that God promised Abraham. And we'll see this starting in Gen.ÿ12. But that was a central part of the heritage of these people. They were heirs of Abraham, and therefor heirs of the promise to inherit the land. So, for these people, the land was a central focus and a big idea. When they heard the term `<em>eretz</em>, they would think of a different picture than we. Namely, they would think of the land that God was giving them. <h2><em>tohu wabohu</em></h2> Well, it says here that the ""land"" was ""formless and void."" Well, it's kind of interesting the term that is used here. It's kind of a limrick term: tohu wabohu. The interpretations of this couplet are endless. But we ought to give the most weight to what these Jewish people, wondering around in the wilderness would have thought. Interestingly, this couplet comes up one other time, and it happens to be in the Pentateuch. In Deut.ÿ32:10, Moses uses <em>tohu wabohu</em> to refer to the desert that the Israelites wondered around in for 40 years! ""This is <em>tohu wabohu</em>!"" And from there, God goes on to prepare the land for human habitation--a land which was <em>tohu wabohu</em>, hospitable only to scorpions, snakes and lizards. <h2>Preparation of the land</h2> So, I see Gen. 1, not as the creation of the entire universe, but as a description of how God prepared the world for human habitation. Since it is not about the creation of the entire world, and only about how God prepared the land, which he owns, for human habitation, then the events of Gen.ÿ1 are events which could have occurred quite recently. And they may have been in 7 relatively short epochs, as this record states. This would allow for an undetermined amount of time to pass previous to that. And it says virtually nothing about the processes he used to create the various life-forms. <h1>What does this say?</h1> Now, before we conclude, we need to think about what it is that we are saying here. We're saying that the author is concerned with portraying God as the creator, the shaper of the land--the land in which he was going to place humankind. <h2>God's sovereignty</h2> In essence, what we're looking at in Genesis 1 is a message about God's sovereignty. It says, ""God owns this place and not you. It says, ""God is God, and you aren't."" It's the same message that Tom talked about last week as he addressed the thorny issue of God's sovereignty. As I said at the beginning, the stakes are very high in this debate. Because if the evidence pointed towards naturalistic evolution, then we would never have to worry about a sovereign God and his claims on our lives. On the other hand, if the evidence points towards an ultimate source, then we are confronting a God who is so powerful, he could give rise to this entire universe. I think this has implications not just for non-Christians who don't believe in God, but also for us Christians. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: The people in ancient times used to shrink God into something controllable and understandable by making idols. They were small gods. Gods that the right ritual or trick could control. But this is no bygone era. It's what we do to God too. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We make up a God, who kind of hovers around the building with stained glass on the corner. And you appease him by showing up once a week to sing songs and give some money! But then the rest of your life is yours! What a keen invention! God in a box, like jack in the box. Gen. 1 says the fact is, God owns everything. He owns you and me. He owns the whole world. And if we could sum up the central message of the Bible, it would be that we, as humans need to recognize that and come to him on those terms. Now, if you don't believe God exists, that's one thing. I would love to dialogue about that. But if you do believe in God's existence, isn't something out of place when we still run the show? Isn't something wrong when we are the gods of our own lives? This is what the Bible calls ""sin."" You can call it whatever you want. I'm not partial to any term. I like to think of it as self-will and pride myself. But the Bible says that we need to come to God and admit that this is the way we are, and receive his forgiveness. That's right, forgiveness. If you have a hard time with that concept, then you haven't comprehended who we're talking about. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Now, if some one of you came up here and said, ""Buck, I really need you to forgive me for not listening to you, and just not paying attention to you."" I would say, ""Look, you and 5 billion other people. Don't lose any sleep over it."" But that's me. Don't think of God in terms of another human. It truly is out of line to reject the sovereignty of the sovereign God. And, for that, the Bible contends we need to come to God in humility and receive his forgiveness. And this forgiveness has been bought for us by Jesus' death on the cross. So, if we do come to God with an attitude of humility and seek his forgiveness. He will not only give us this, but he will restore a relationship between ourselves and him that ought to be thereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And he really is a God of love, so this shouldn't be too painfulÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04931.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Apologetics - Buck McCallum",

"Colossians 1: Growing in your Relationship With God",1993-08-12,,"  <h1>Intro</h1> The book of Colossians is great because here Paul is generally concerned for the spiritual well-being of these people. He doesn't know them personally. But he has heard of them. They are new Christians and he is just concerned that they know the scoop, how to grow, things to watch out for, etc. I thought we'd take the last few weeks of summer here and look at a few of the issues that are really important for us as Christians, to growÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Tonight we're looking at a prayer that Paul prays for these Colossians where he expresses his basic hopes for them?the things he really wants to see happen in their lives. So you can think of this prayer in that light. If I didn't know these people, but I knew they were young Christians, what would I pray for them? What we'll see is that this prayer forms a basis for the expectations we can have. What does God want to see happen to us? What is the ideal? I thought it would be interesting to ask that question of some of us. What impression did you have of Christianity? What did you think would happen to you if you became a Christian? <h1>What will happen?</h1> <h2>Knowledge of his will</h2> This is the kind of stuff you want from God. Think of what it is that you would want from Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. it would be knowledge of what it's all about! When he expresses this idea of being filled with the knowledge of God's will, it's a general sense of being in tune with what God wants. You're in touch with God's perspective on things. You know the way God thinksÿ.ÿ.ÿ. He states that it is by means of ""wisdom and spiritual discernment."" I don't want to pretend that this is some super-mystical thing. Because we know that much of God's wisdom is here in the scriptures. But there is also such a thing as spiritual wisdom and spiritual knowledge. And you meet people who have it. Maybe you know people who have it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Have you ever talked to someone who could just see right through you? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Have you ever gone to people for answers, and there is one person who just has the deepest insight? This is kind of neat. It's something I've wanted. That's one of the reasons I've given myself to studying the scriptures. It's also one of the reasons I spend time getting close to people who are like thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Living in a way that's worthy of the Lord and pleases him</h2> But he also says that he prays they will live in a way that's worthy of the Lord. The idea that they will live in a way that is comensurate with a relationship with God. And he expands on this to say that it means, ""Pleasing God in everythingÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Now, I have to make a distinction here between loving someone and being pleased by a person. I may love a person completely, but the things the do may not make me happy. Let's make a distinction between a person and what that person doesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. With people you feel like their pleasure is used as a tool over you. If they're not pleased with you, then that's very serious and could result in rejection. So it makes you want to forget all about pleasing other people. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've always had an intense desire to please people. But because I don't want to be the victim of anyone's whims, I've had to put on an air (a facade) that I could care less what people think of me! The thing about God is I never have to worry about whether he loves me or not. That's not what we're talking about here. His love for me always says the same. And so the only question is, can I even have the privilege of making God happy? Can I bring pleasure to his heart? Look at what it is to live in a way that pleases the Lord. He says in the following sentenceÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Picture this. God says, ""This is what would make me happy. This is what would please me. If you had a productive and fruitful life, if you got to know me well, and if you had all kinds of power."" Honestly, that would make me happy too! Is this what God really wants? Could it be that God wants these things for you? Are you sure he doesn't want something else? Think of the stereotypes of what makes God happy: if you don't break the rules, if you are a prudish person, if you sit through lots of boring church meetingsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Bearing fruit</h2> But instead, God says, ""I want you to bear fruit,"" meaning that he wants our lives to have meaning. He wants us to make a difference. He wants us to count for something. I'll be if we went around here and asked, ""What is the best thing that has happened to you since you became a Christian?"" many people would point to this right here. Because the contrast is so stark. Before God begins to give us direction we focus on such small things. What am I going to do today? How can I feel good? And even the long term things, like careers and education, for many people who are thoughtful, they wonder, ""Why? Why am I chasing the suburban dream? Why am I pursuing this career? Is it because that's what my parents want?"" But when God comes into the picture you choose a career with his will in mind. How will you be able to impact others for him through this career? How will you be able to make a permanent and eternal impact through your education? It's very exciting! It's a whole new perspective, ""What eternal purpose does God have for me?"" The world we live in is so cynical. ""You are just you. Things don't change. You're a very small person in a world full of problems. So you might as well just get about the business of personal peace and affluence."" I hope you don't listen to that. I hope some of us here believe God that he wants us to bear fruit in our life and make a difference. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We think today of people like the apostles. ""Peter, Johnÿ.ÿ.ÿ. They were apostles!"" But the truth is they were just fishermen, one was an accountant. They were very common people from small towns. And Jesus gave these guys a huge vision. Frequently I get the question, ""Buck, what do you think I could do?"" And I love that question, when I know the person and can answer it honestly. Because I've seen so many people who the world would have written off as insignificant become very powerful and effective servants of the Lord. <h2>Increasing in the knowledge of him</h2> He says also that what would make him happy is if we got to know him more. Here is something that is very interesting. Getting to know God. It's a goal that I've really longed for. But I also see it as something that have a long way to go on. It's encouraging for me to see that what God wants is for me to get to know him personally. And to a degree, it has happened and I'm happy with my relationship with God. But I'm also unhappy. I'm also dissatisfied. Because I know that there so much more. I know that there is distance there. And it frustrates me. I feel like sometimes we talk about God, and we learn about God, but I'm just beating around the bush. I'm not directly face to face with him. There is a passage that has spoken to me on this topic in Romansÿ9:15, 16ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The context of this saying is when Moses says, ""God, can I see you face to face?"" Moses wanted that kind of intimacy with God. And Paul says, ""It does not depend on the striving of man or human effort."" I think that young Christians would give themselves too much credit for knowing God. ""I have tried to know God."" I think that as young Christians we tend to put too much of an emphasis on our own effort and our own worthiness and not enough on God's grace. In fact there's another passage where Paul himself admits that the greatness of the revelation he received from God really put his ego to the test. He was tempted to become haughty and prideful because of the extent to which God had revealed himself to him. I can see this with myself. I think if I was really on the inside track with God, if were were face to face, I'm not sure I would know how to handle that. I know I could see myself taking a lot of credit for that. So God has so work to do on my character before we can really have what he wantsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Strengthened with all power</h2> There is such a thing as spiritual power. Again, I think it's the kind of thing that is not granted to the power-hungry. But it is real. And I can think of many examples of times when I have seen it in my life and others around me. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I can think of times when people have spoken to me with such conviction, it was the voice of God himself. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I can think of times when I haven't had power. I remember once I was leading a Bible study and the people in that Bible study rose up and mutinied against my leadership. I was shocked. I did not understand. I went to another Christian for advice. He said, ""They wouldn't have done that to so-and-so, would they?"" I thought about it, ""No, they wouldn't have!"" ""I'll tell you why. He's got spiritual authority. He's got spiritual power, and you don't."" I saw it. It's elusive. It is hard to put your fingers on. You certainly can't pretend you have it. But it's real. I think power and authority, used rightly, is a great thing. Nobody wants to be a weakling. There are probably some of us here who are weak. But it's not like we said, ""I want to be weak."" We probably wish we weren't weak. We wish we could get some things done. That's why you want power. There are people who get strong andÿ work out so that they can kick some butt. You can do that in the physical world. But not with God. Not with spiritual power. The key to having spiritual power is to have humility.ÿ It's to know that it's not from me. In IÿCor.ÿ12:9 God says, 'My power is perfectedÿ in weakeness."" So there is a paradox hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. For the sake of being able to get things done, I want power. But I also know that I must have humilityÿ.ÿ.ÿ. &nbsp; &nbsp;",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04976.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1996 - Buck McCallum",

"Colossians 2: Growing in your Relationship with God",1993-08-19,," There are other voicesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (2:8) I want to talk about Jesus Christ tonight. But I want to start in Colossians 2:8, where Paul warns us that there are competing voices in our lives that vie for our attention. And he calls them here, ""Hollow and empty philosophyÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Paul knows that we love to listen to just about anyone, before Jesus Christ. Even though Christ is God himself, we would rather listen to something else. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People are listening today to this John Bradshaw guy. And without cracking on John, I just ask myself, ""Where does he get this stuff from? The talking to dolls. The inner child. The various steps and formulas?"" And he speaks them all with such authority! Here is the truth, that I agree with Paul about: We would more readily listen to him than Jesus Christ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I listen to music a lot. Most of the particular lyrics are kind of laughable. You don't take them all that serious. But I do notice that there is an overall impression I get from listening to the music I listen to. And that is a very negative, critical, sarcastic outlook on life. I may tend to be that way already. But listening to that perspective adds to my bombastic, negative and sarcastic ways. It affects me deeply. I know someone else might develop a philosophy of love and romance from listening to their favorite music. Or another person might develop a belief about themselves, or that life sucks. The amazing thing about music, musicians and stars is that we listen to these people (they're featured in columns for what they thinkÿ.ÿ.ÿ.), but their lives are so un-together. They're working on their fourth marriage. They live in some surreal, plastic world that we'll never relate to. But we listen to them. This is what Paul is trying to crack on here. The stupid traditions of men are more important to us than what the God of the universe has to say. <h1>Christ was God (v. 9)</h1> And Paul is definitely trying to make the point that Christ was nothing less than God himself. He does this by repetition. He says ""all"", meaning ""every bit""?of the ""fulness"", meaning the ""completeness, everything about God,"" was in Christ in bodily form. <h2>Frequently watered down</h2> One of the reasons that Paul is emphasizing this so much is because there were teachers stopping by this city who said that Jesus was a great guy, but he was just an enlightened teacher. Now, if that sounds familiar to you, it's because one of the most popular forms of teaching today also says the same thing. That would be what we loosely refer to as ""New Age Philosophy."" New Age religion is really smorgasbord, a cafeteria-line approach to religion. The basic tenet of New Age thinking is ""believe whatever you want."" Usually it turns out to be kind of a mix of some Christian ideals with some eastern religious teaching. But one of the common elements is that they have to deal with Jesus Christ. And what you will find is they water down his own teaching about himself. No one wants to say, ""Jesus, don't pay attention to him."" So what they'll do is water down the things he said about himself. Because there is no doubt that he claimed to be God. In a passage very similar to this one he was asked by his disciples to reveal God to them. ""Jesus, show us the Father,"" they asked. And Jesus' reply was, ""If you have seen me, you have seen the Father."" (show Johnÿ14:8,ÿ9) There was another passage in Johnÿ10:30 where Jesus said outright to his jewish audience, ""I and the Father are one."" They knew something that a lot of other people today don't seem to realize, namely, that nice people and good teachers don't say that type of thing. He's not a good man if he says, ""I am God."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you'd said that kind of thing to Muhammed, he would have torn his clothes and cut off your head! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If you'd said that kind of thing to the Buddha, he would have said, ""You show a very un-enlightened mind to ask that sort of question."" Nobody in their right mind claims to be God. Come on! Try for a minute to put yourself in Jesus' shoes, saying, ""If you've seen me, then you've seen God himself!"" If you can imagine yourself saying that, you should be concerned! A guy who says that kind of thing is either a complete nut?really deluded?or he's telling the truth. There's no room for this, ""He was a nice man"" type of thing. Tonight we don't have time to discuss the evidence for whether Christ was legitimate in this claim. But just in passing, I'll note that Jesus himself said, ""If you want proof, I'll give you this: I will be killed and I will raise from the dead on the third day."" One of the great challenges for sckeptics is to explain how it is that with Jesus predicting, ""I'm going to raise from the dead,"" and the people who killed him (the Romans and Jewish rulers) saying, ""No you're not."" And with them placing a 24-hour guard over his body. The early Christians were able to say with confidence, ""He has risen from the dead. I have seen him. Hundreds of people have seen him."" And no one could raise a shred of evidence to refute them. No one could say, ""Here's the body! He's still dead!"" It's really a very compelling piece of evidence for Christ's claims. I can direct you to some good reading on this subject if you want some more: <em>The Son Rises: Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus,</em> by Wm. L. Craig; <em>More Than a Carpenter</em>, by Josh McDowell. <h2>The Trinity</h2> We ought to take a moment and talk about how it is that Jesus is God and God is God. This is a teaching we see in the Bible where there is more than one person who is God. Actually, there are three. There are three persons who are Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Now, it's not so hard to conceive of three Gods. It's not hard to conceive of many Gods. But that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about one God, who is three persons. One God, three persons. That's where it gets kind of puzzling. How can one be three? Well, the way the Bible portrays it to us is that they are three persons, but they are so unified that they are one. It tries to portray this through imagery like this, that of a family. There is a basic unity there in an <em>ideal </em>family. Their oneness may come from communication. They may be in such complete harmony of thought and communication that they are one. Or, it may be that there is something in the very nature of God that makes him one and dependant on each other. It's a little bit tough for us to understand. But there is one parallel in the world, that God put here. In the relationship of marriage, when God created it, he pronounced, ""The two should become one."" God's ideal in marriage was such a level of trust, communication, dependance, etc., that the two become like one. This idea is virtually laughable in a culture with so much marital failure. And you certainly wont' see an idea like that come out of Hollywood. But that was God's ideal. And I think it reflects the way he is. So, this is how it is that we can have three persons who are actually God. <h1>Application: Things Jesus taught us about God</h1> When it comes to applying this teaching, that Jesus was God, I think it's very exciting just to look at Jesus from that point of view. God was on the earth living as a human. He walked around and did stuff. I find that to be fascinating. There is so much we can learn about God from the life of Jesus. <h2>God parties (Luke 7:34)</h2> This is a remarkable thing here. What does it take to get a reputation as a gluttonous man or a drunkard? I'm sure a lot of us here could easily get that reputation. But this is God! God came to earth and earned the reputation of being a gluttonous man and a drunkard! Do you think most Christians would ever get called these names here? But God did. <h2>God is funny (Matt. 5:29; Luke 6:42; Matt. 17:27)</h2> In a passage we talked about a couple weeks ago, Christ says, ""If you lust with your eyes, tear them out!"" That kind of outrageousness is typical of him. And he says, ""If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off."" Again, if he wasn't laughing on the outside, he had to be cracking up on the inside. It's so outrageous. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Imagine your friend coming to you and saying, ""I've been struggling with lust lately. Been masturbating some."" And you reply, ""Well, maybe you should gouge out your eyes and chop your hands off!"" In another passage he says, ""If you're going to take a speck out of someone's eye, you should remove the log from your own!"" There's another passage where Jesus' disciples are challenged about whether they pay taxes or not. And Jesus says, ""OK, fine. Go catch a fish and the first fish you catch will have a coin in it. Take the coin and pay our taxes for us."" Again, this is great. Because you try and put yourself in that situation. ""It's time to pay taxes, and Jesus says to go fishing for my taxes!"" I find this kind of sarcasm, or irony to be typical of Jesus. <h2>God is convicting (John 8:1-11)</h2> To be around Jesus was to be exposed. You had to be honest because he knew people so well. <h2>God bonds with people (John 11:33-36)</h2> This is a story where one of Jesus' friends dies. And Jesus is openly gushing about it. He even knows he's going to raise his friend from the dead. But he sees how his family is broken up and weeping. And he just can't stand it, because he is personally and emotionally close to these people. There's also another passage in the book of Matthew where Jesus is spending his last night with his disciples and he says, ""This is the last time we're going to have wine together till we see each other in heaven."" And then they sing a hymn together. It's a very emotional and tender moment.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04977.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1996 - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 4: Sharing your Faith",1993-09-09,,"  <h1>Intro</h1> We're finishing up our series on Colossians tonight. What I want to talk about is the topic of sharing Christ with people. It's a fascinating thing to me to look at our culture and see how negatively evangelism, witnessing, proseletizing is viewed. I think part of the negative view people have is related to something we've talked about in here before?the notion that all ways lead to God. The idea that it doesn't matter what you believe. Whatever you believe is true for you. This way of thinking has so permeated our culture that the notion of trying to persuade someone that the way you believe is true and that they need to accept the way you believe is seen as medival, egotistical. It's associated somehow with fundamentalism and narrow-mindedness. Just a while ago we spent a whole week talking about the notion of truth, and whether one view can be right and others wrong. There is also a seminar on this topic coming up in the month of November which should be very goodÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So I don't want to belabor the point right here. But I do want to say that when you really think about it, there are some real problems with saying, ""Whatever you believe is true for you."" I know of no area of my experience where that actually works. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I could say, ""My car is the fastest car on the road,"" but I'll be disappointed. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I could say, ""My house is worth $100,000,"" but nobody will buy it. So in every area of life, it doesn't matter so much what you believe as what is actually true. But then people pick out this one area, which happens to be the most serious area of all, and they say, 'Whatever you believe is true for you."" I feel real uncomfortable with that, to the point that I think it is one of the most damaging values or beliefs our culture holds right now. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's one thing to point at some ""fundamentalist"" over in some country and say, ""See how they're killing each other over their beliefs! I don't want to be like that!"" But then to go to the opposite end of the spectrum and say, ""It doesn't matter what you believe!"" I just doesn't follow. So, the basis that our culture criticizes evangelism on is very shakey. On the other hand, I realize Christians are also negative about sharing their faith. There are a lot of fears there. There are fears of rejection. There are fears that it just won't work?that I'll fail. In thinking about this, I've realized that's not been my experience. The rejection, the deaf ears, the disinterest that we think we'll see, that's not what I've seen. Oh, I've been rejected or shunned because I'm a Christian. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've been in groups of my friends where they've chided me for still being into that Jesus crap. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've had people say, ""Whatever you do, don't try to convert me!"" Regardless of how much you might fear that kind of reaction, I find it absolutely fascinating. Why do you say that? Why do you have that reaction? Almost always the reasons people give are very insightful. I remember one person who went on to tell me stories of experiences he had that were truly revolting. And I had to agree, who would want to be treated like that! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I had another person tell me that he didn't want to hear it because he didn't care. And it was funny, because as it came out of his mouth, you could tell that it wasn't really true. And then after that he would ask questions about things that showed he actually did care and he was interested. He just wanted to put that front out there for some kind of protection. But for the most part, the response I have seen out of people when I talk to them about the good news of Jesus Christ has been interest. The response I have seen is that it arouses needs and hungers that are deep inside a person. I see questions. I hear honest longings from people that they wish they had more meaning in their life, or that they wish they could know God, or that they wish they could find an answer for their guilt. The myth that people aren't that interested, or that sharing the gospel won't work?that it won't have any effect?is largely held by people who never share Christ with anyone. I want to talk about this some more when we get into the text. But I think that most of the fears associated with evangelism are held by those who don't do it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have taken people jumping before. I've always liked jumping off things into water. Of course there are jumps that are dangerous. But there are also jumps that are just plain fun. They aren't dangerous. They don't hurt. They feel good. And what you'll see is someone who has never done it, someone who is fearful, will come up to the edge and think about it for a long time. And I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone finally jump, and from that point on they are racing. Run up and jump, run up and jump, as if they're making up for lost time! I think those of us who have not shared Christ very much or not at all need to keep an open mind here. Try to imagine that some of our fears are not really true. <h1>God first (vv. 2-4)</h1> With those introductory thoughts, let's get into the passage itself. I think it's so insightful where Paul starts on this topic of sharing your faith (read). He starts with prayer. A lot of people are mistaken in thinking that sharing your faith begins with talking to another person. But it starts with God. The very nature of the good news is you can have a relationship with God. God is using us as his spokespersons to reach out and tap people on the shoulder and say, ""Hey, I'm here. And I want a relationship with you."" It's not a philosophy. It's not a lifestyle. It's a personal relationship with the living God. That's why we turn to God and say, ""OK God, who? Who should I talk to? <em>You</em> give me the words to say. <em>You</em> communicate through me."" <h2>God guides and empowers</h2> To me, this helps to make evangelism excting. When you know that God is guiding you. When you know that he is putting you in contact with someone who is really searching and he is there with you. When you know that he is giving you the words to say. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Virtually everyone I have talked to, who has shared their faith with people, has had the same experience. ""I was saying things I didn't know I could say! Things were just flowing. I had the sense that God was speaking through me!"" So there is the fact that God does speak through us. But he also guides us. He leads us to people who are seeking him. If there is a seeking person out there, which there are (Jesus said the harvest is plentifulÿ.ÿ.ÿ.), then God will see to it that one of his spokes-persons gets there. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: There's a story in Acts where this guy named Phillip is directed by God to walk out into a desert road. And there was this guy in a chariot, reading a copy of the Bible! And Phillip walked up to him and said, ""What are you doing?"" He said, ""I'm reading this stuff that's amazing! But I can't understand it. Can you explain it to me?"" If there is a seeking person, and if there is a willing messenger, God will make sure that the two get together. That is why I never want to take the people I meet as just accidents. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was broken down last week on my way home from vacation. And this guy named Ike pulled over to help me out. It turned out that we were together for hours working on my car. The guy was great. But Ike himself said, ""Buck, these things don't happen by chance."" And I thought to myself, ""You don't know how right you are."" Durring our time together we had some time for me to share my testimony and why I'm into Jesus Christ. And I also got his address to continue to send him things. So you guys can pray for Ike. <h2>The motivation for evangelism is our relationship with God</h2> I think there is another key insight here. And that is that our motivation for sharing our faith should come from our own relationship with God. In other words, there are times when I have very little desire to share Christ with anyone because my own relationship with him is pitiful. And there are times when I'm very excited about sharing with others because I want them to have the good thing I have. I don't want to put anyone on a guilt trip here. I don't believe that is an effective motivator for evangelism. But I do want us to reflect. If you're not someone who shares you faith, is it because your own relationship with God is not very real? Is it something you're living vicariously through other people? Is it purely accedemic? Maybe some of us need to start by spending time with God and working on our relationship with God. <h1>Be sensitive (v. 5, 6)</h1> Paul goes on in v. 5ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. There are a couple excellent points here. One of them is what we've been talking about, that God is going to give us opportunities. He is giving us opportunities to share with people who are already seeking. We just need to pray that we can spot those opportunities and take advantage of them. <h2>People's needs are unique</h2> But he also says here, ""Be wiseÿ.ÿ.ÿ. so you know how to respond to each person."" Paul is telling us here that sharing our faith is not like phone-sales. I'm sure you've had that experience where a phone salesman is giving you the exact same pitch that he's been giving everyone else. And when you say one thing, they have a precise come-back they've practiced on 1000 other people. And it's very irritating. But I think a lot of Christians have this impression about evangelism. They think that the odds of being successful are about the same as if you were trying to sell vaccum cleaners over the phone. Because they've gotten the mistaken impression that it is a formula of some kind. The truth is that every person is different. And people become seekers of God for so many different reasons. Some seek God because they're lonely. Some because they can't answer the deep questions of life. Some because of what they've seen in other Christians. Some because of emptiness. Some fear death. Some because of a tragedyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is why it's so ineffective to put too much of an emphasis on what you have to say. Definitely, the good news needs to get out. Definitely, if we don't speak up then the person will never hear. But we also need to take the time to understand people. I've tried to find some kind of correlation between people who are effective at sharing their faith and I have not found the ones you might expect. You might expect them to be the classic ""salesman personality."" Not so. You might expect them to be effective arguers. Not so. You might expect them to be great communicators. Not so. The one correlation I have seen is that they are genuinely interested in and care about people. They ask questions. They are interested in the answers. They care about people. And it's in that context that you start to see a person's needs. You start to see what it is about them that makes them hungry for God. You start to see why God sent them your way. I feel like I have to understand a person's hunger before I give him food. <h2>Seasoned with grace</h2> Then, finally, Paul says that our speach ought to be seasoned with grace. Grace is a word that speaks of God's love. He's saying that God's love ought to permeate our come-off with people. What more basic and obvious point could we make here? We're sharing God's love. That's the message. And so our speach and come-off should be full of it. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How incongruous it is to be sharing God's love with someone in a spirit of judgment! (read ""Columbus Frolics on Lord's Day"" add) With Jesus Christ, the most attractive thing about him, the reason people wanted to be close to him, was not his miracles. It was the fact that he was accepting and lovingÿ.ÿSure, there were people who clammored for miracles or healing. But the people who wanted to get close toÿ him, theÿ people who wanted to hang out with him, did so because they saw how accepting and loving he was. I hope tonight, if there is anything you take away from here, it is the idea that God is loving. That is the good news. God is loving, he wants to forgive you for your sins, and he wants to have a relationship with you. That's our message in a nutshell. It's so simple, but to me so powerful. You can turn to God tonight in prayer and say, ""God, I want your forgiveness. I do want a relationship with you."" And God will take you up on that!",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t04979.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 1996 - Buck McCallum",

"Resolving Conflict: Interpesonal Conflict",1993-09-23,," <h1>Intro</h1> Tonight we're starting a series on conflict, which is a staple of my life. I'm critical and judgmental. I'm competitive and prideful. I'm rebellious. And I have a big mouth, so I say a lot of things to hurt people. It all makes for a lot of conflict. One thing we've done for this series is to distinguish between different types of conflict. For example, when someone really bugs you, and no matter what they do you can't stand it, then often the problem is not any particular issue. Often the problem is an emotional problem. That person has hurt you, or offended you, or somehow left a scar. So now almost anything they do is unbearable. And there is conflict that is more subtle that comes from the very nature of your relationship with another person. For example, peers, especially in the teens and early 20's, tend to compete with one another about almost anything. And there are often tensions with authorities. But tonight we want to talk about the type of conflict that comes up when you disagree with someone or when there is some kind of bone of contention between you and another person. <h1>Let's think of a few examplesÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> Let's think of a few examplesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was arguing today with my brother about why some things have happened. We were looking at the cause of some of the things that have happened in this church. And our argument was in a good tone. I think it was probably informative for both of us. But at the same time there was tension there. Afterwards I kept thinking about it. ""I should have said this!"" And, ""Wait till next timeÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" kind of envisioning how our next conversation was going to go. I was kind of surveying around today with people about conflict they have been in. I was asking them to describe to me some of the scenarios they encounter. And I heard a lot of different ones. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: One guy told me he conflicts with his mother when she gets over-protective or controlling. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Another person told me she fights with her roommates when they're too messy. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Another person said he's argued with someone about recycling. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I had people tell me how they are in repeated conflict with their families about their faith. They'll go home and get attacked (or so they say), for what they believe or the fact that they're going to Bible studies or something. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People talked about situations where they were already irritable, and then it just took a difference of opinion to set things off. All of the sudden you're calling each other names and stuff. The thing that makes issue-oriented conflict distinct is that you have a good or neutral rapore with the person, it's the issue that makes the conflict. Of course, it can quickly turn into a more personal thing, especially if the issue drags on for a long time without resolution or if you approach the conflict too competitively. I want to say three things about issues-oriented conflict tonight. First I want to critique the way this world looks at issues-oriented conflict. Second, I want to look at the way God handles issues-oriented conflict. And third I want to consider one of the greatest poisons, the gasoline we pour on conflict. And that is our own insecurity. <h1>The world's ideal: No conflict over issues</h1> If we look at the way the world looks at conflict today, I would say the ideal is that we don't conflict over issues. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Miss Manners would say it's impolite to take issue with a person just because you disagree! As we talked last week about confrontation, the normal approach to confrontation is to confront someone only if they offend you or hurt you. And like we talked about last week, more often than not, that's the situation where we should just let it slide. That's the situation where we can be sacrificial and simply forgive someone. Having issues-oriented conflict with someone is based in the notion that there are ideals worth conflicting over. There is such a thing as right and wrong, not just different opinions. There are morals or truths worth discussing or even arguing about. That is an idea that is tremendously unpopular. On the other extreme we have people who disagree with you about everything. They are idealogues to the extreme. And they're rigid thinkers. And they can't accept the notion of letting someone slide. They can't imagine hearing someone they disagree with and not saying, ""Well, actuallyÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" I don't know if you've ever had someone like this in your life?someone who you're always arguing with. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was reflecting last week how I was kind of like this at one time in my life. It was in the area of theological truth, biblical teaching. Before I went to school, I fancied myself as knowing quite a bit of the Bible and how it should be understood. And when I got to school I found some people who disagreed with me, and were able to argue their positions very effectively. And, sadly, they were also the same people who were grading my papers. I found myself speaking out in class and raising my hand, to an extent that a year or two later I was embarassedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember being confronted at one time in my life about they way I confronted people about their music. I had a very clear understanding of what good music was. I knew what bad music was and why. And I had no problem critiquing people's music selection and tastes. And this friend finally blew up at me and said, ""You have a way of making people feel like they're wrong for the music they listen to!"" And I realized that's really kind of stupidÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But there are times when we should take issue with someone. And we should be willing to argue. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When someone holds a belief that you see as potentially threatening to their well-being. Beliefs do make a difference. If someone believes that all ways lead to God, that is a very profound belief. And it has powerful implications for your choices in life. You already know how I feel about thatÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And I would be willing to argue with a person about that (hopefully in a gracious manner). <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When someone is exhibiting a behavior that is harmful. The example of the alcoholic is classic here, but there are many more behaviors that are harmful. The pursuit of money to the exclusion of other values. Or excessively egotistical behavior. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When a personal issue between you and another person is irritating enough or large enough that you can't just put it aside. I used to have a roommate who was really stinkyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But you could have issues with people like the way they treat you, like their messinessÿ.ÿ.ÿ. These are all issues that have to be talked out. <h1>Let's think of how God deals with us</h1> Let's just think for a minute about how God deals with us on these kinds of issues. Because God does disagree with us about many things. <h2>His accceptance is unconditional (2ÿTim.ÿ2:13)</h2> For one thing, we know that his acceptance of us as person is uconditional. In 2ÿTim. he saysÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Even if we have such severe conflict with God that we walk away from him, he still loves us. There's a story of this kind of love in Lukeÿ15ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. There is no question that the father disagreed with that son. But in spite of that, when his son returned, his father ran out to great him with a hug and rejoicingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So God is capable of making a distinction between an issue he might have with us and us as people. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember having a conflict with a boss once. I don't know if any of you have ever been told this or not, but it's kind of hard to take. He said, ""I can't stand people like you. And I don't have to, so you're fired."" Normally I might have said, ""Is there something I can work onÿ.ÿ.ÿ.?"" But I realized it's me he doesn't like. He's rejecting me! That is personal rejection. And that is something you'll never experience from God. That is, if you have received his forgiveness. Not everyone stands under the forgiveness and acceptance of God. That is a gift that you have to decide upon. You have to receive God's forgiveness. He's offering it to you, but He's not forcing it upon you. Once you do have his forgiveness, he doesn't go back on his promiseÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So that is a key element in the way God deals with us. He may have an issue with us, but he does not reject us because of that issue. And if there's anything we could learn about dealing with each other it's thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>Insecurity</h1> The last thing I want to consider about conflict between us is the problem of insecurity. Insecurity comes up when you feel weak. You may feel weak because of your position. You may feel weak because of who you are in comparisson to someone else. And insecurity has a way of really screwing up conflict. <h2>1 Kings 12</h2> To understand this I want to look at a story that is kind of humorous but tragic in the OT. It's the story of Rehoboam in IÿKingsÿ12ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Rehoboam was Solomon's son. And Solomon was one of the greatest kings Israel had ever had. Now comes Solomon's son. And one of the first things people do when he takes the throne is come to him and complain about some injustices that his father had left behind. Namely, his father had them building (with virtually free labor), many cities and fortresses and thigns that kings build. And they were tired of it. And if you read the list of thigns that Solomon had them buildÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So they make this request of Rehoboam, ""Lighten our load."" The story then tells us of a contrast between two different answers. The first is from the older counselors who counselled Solomon. The second is from the young men who were Rehoboam's friendsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. What explains their response? It is the desire to win. It is the desire to be strong. It is the desire to assert myselfÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And this is precisely what happens when someone is insecure. Rehoboam was young. He was insecure in his new position. Perhaps he was insecure because he was following in the footsteps of someone so great as Solomon. When someone is insecure, they have to win. When someone is insecure, they see your disagreement as a personal assault. When someone is insecure, the conflict is totally threatening. <h2>I Cor. 6:7</h2> Paul says in IÿCorÿ.ÿ.ÿ. You can't say that kind of thing if you're insecure. <h2>Where do we get our security from?</h2> Sadly, tonight we don't have time to go into the huge topic of insecurity, except to say that God wants to make us people who are completely secure. He wants to cure us of the disease of constantly needing the approval of others. He wants to help us rise above the threat that other people pose in our lives. And he wants to do that by becoming the most important, secure, central relationship in our livesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The outcome, of course, for Rehoboam is that it backfired. He lost 5/6 of his kingdomÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05033.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Relationships - Buck McCallum",
"Resolving Conflict: Emotion-Oriented Conflict",1993-09-30,," <h1>Intro</h1> What we're talking about tonight is the scenario where the conflict between you and another person is not so much an issue as it is an emotional scar. You know the situation where everything someone does is an irritation to you? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember one relationship I had that meant a lot to me was with this guy named Mark. And the thing that used to really hurt me about Mark was that he was really passive with me. It seemed like if there was a conversation to start, it had to start with me. If someone was going to be first to show that they needed the other person, it had to be meÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In my mind I told myself, ""It's because I'm more secure. It's because I'm more mature,"" and various self-congradulatory things like that. But in my heart, I felt like he didn't need me as much as I needed him. And that really hurt. There would be times when I would just start to judge him. I would sit around and think about what a complete, self-centered, loser of a friend he was. And then we'd start getting in fights over little things. I'd see the way he slept in in the mornings, ""You are so weak!"" ""You're so judgmentalÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" The issue was much deeper and emotional than any one thing. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Just to give another illustration of what I'm talking about. I was in a conflict a few years ago with my brother. Both of us are very volatile. And we also have the gift of extreme statements. So in the context of a fight we would say things about each other that were very sweeping and damning. What I would do and what he would do is we would latch onto the thing the other person had said that was outrageous. And in my mind I would replay that again and again. And from that point on, it wouldn't have mattered what else he said. ""He called me a name,"" or ""he put me downÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" was all I could think. Those hurtful things became the issue. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: This is the kind of poison that destroys marriagesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So, as we think about this you've got to think about those people who can hurt you. You've got to think about your family. There may be things that your parents or brothers or sisters have done, and they've done them so many times, that now you have just walled that person off from your life. Or you constantly judge that person. You've got to think of someone you've had a romantic relationship with. And the relationship was painful. So now you just can't stand that person. Of course, what happens in life is that we become more and more closed off from people. We learn to spot danger quicker and avoid it faster. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When you were a little kid, you didn't hesitate to say, ""Me and Jim are going to be best friends!"" But as you get older you realize that you have to be more cautiousÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: At some point you start asking people out. But the experience of a lot of people is that they have a lot of different relationships and they end painfully. So you get to the point where you like being single! Or maybe you resort to the dating service or the classifieds to have more screening. The natural course of things is to get more and more isolated in life. What I want to talk about tonight is the idea of emotional conflict, when someone hurts you, and what we can do about it. I want to focus on the area of our emotions, because I think our culture had really lost it's way here. <h1>Emotions are revealing</h1> The first thing I want to say is that these emotional conflicts are very revealing. (Matt. 12:34; 15:18; Luke 6:45; Prov. 27:19). These emotional reactions that we have to other people say so much about us. We think that our emotions tell us the way another person is. We think our emotions are a gauge of how someone treated us. And there is an interaction between external stimuli and our internal reaction. But by far the emotions we feel say something about us. <h2>Prov. 27:19</h2> The Proverbs very simply sayÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The term ""heart"" is used several different way in the Bible. But one way it is used quite often is as the seat of passion and emotion. He's saying very simply here that your emotions and passions show a lot about you. <h2>Mark 7:20-23</h2> Jesus spoke a lot on the corruption that reigns within us. And he got into many arguments with people about the issue. Because in his day, as in ours, there was a tendency to think that somehow my problems come from out there. I'm only responding to what is done to me or the things that happen to me."" He spoke so clearly on this in Markÿ7ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Not all of these terms are related to our emotions, although some of them are. Jesus is saying, though, that what goes on inside is much more powerful than the things that happen to us. <h2>Do you see the application?</h2> Do you see the application this has to emotional conflicts? This is something we don't want to admit about ourselves. But the truth is, our strong, emotional reactions to other people say more about us than they do about the other person. These powerful emotions say we are prideful (""No one has the right to hurt me!""). They say we are self-centered. They say we are insecure and self-focused. They say we're self-righteous (""I would never do that kind of thing to another person!""). This is hard to take in the course of conflict. It's hard to take anytime, but especially in the course of conflict. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's just think through a scenario here. Someone attacks me or says something very offensive to me. My immediate reaction is, ""Whew! That hurts!"" That part I can't control, unless I want to hide from people. But now I choose to get angry about it, or offended, or sad and depressedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em>I</em> choose those reactions. Those are <em>my</em> reactions. And the fact that they are so often negative is related to our pridefulness. The fact that we get angry when someone does something is related to our self-centeredness and our self-righteousness. Or it's related to our insecurities. <h2>I'm talking heresy!</h2> I realize I'm talking about an absolute heresy here. In our culture feelings are sacred! We, and our feelings, are victims of what other people do to us! That's what our culture says! The real truth is that our feelings are very corrupt from our own sinfulness. We almost always respond wrongly in our emotions because of our self-centered and sinful nature. That's what our culture wants to avoid. We want to put to sleep the notion of personal responsibility. We want to put to rest the idea of sin. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I did this because it felt right to me. How can you deny the legtimacy of my feelings? We don't have a category anymore for the notion that our feelings might be wrong. This is part of the revolt against the idea of personal responsibility. It's part of the revolt against the notion of sin?that I might be wrong and in need of forgiveness. The whole basis upon which the notion of a relationship with God is predicated (in the Bible) is the fact that we need forgiveness. We're sinners through and through who really need God to forgive us. And that idea is just rejected outright in our culture. <h2>That's why our culture is so cold (Luke 7:47)</h2> In fact, it's one of the main reasons our culture is so unforgiving and so cold. Nobody sees that they need forgiveness. Nobody admits their own sinfulness. So they're unwilling to forgive and accept the sinfulness in others. Jesus said very plainly in Lukeÿ7:47, ""The one who is forgiven much loves muchÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" What he is saying is that when you know how much you have been forgiven, then you can't help but have a heart of compassion for others. But when you're self-righteous, when you don't see where you're wrong, then it's so easy to judge others. It's so easy to justify feelings of hatred, anger, bitterness, vengenceÿ.ÿ.ÿ. because you don't see how wrong you are and how wrong you have been. Being able to handle pain and hurt when other people dish it out to you is directly related to whether you have been forgiven by Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But I don't know one Christian here who is fully aware of how much we've been forgiven for. And that is why we have such a hard time forgiving othersÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>We can change our emotions (Gen. 4:7; Prov. 4:23)</h1> I'm going to go one step further on this. I'm also going to say that we can change our emotions by doing the right thing. Now what do I mean by this? <h2>Gen. 4:7</h2> There's a great example of this in the Bible in Gen. 4ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. What God says to Cain is very insightful. He says, ""If you do right, will not your face be lifted up?"" You'll feel better if you do the right thing. Cain eventually did the wrong thing and he murdered his brother. And I doubt it made him feel any better. But the Bible teaches that you can, in fact, by doing right, have some control over your emotions. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Some of us were talking last week about love. A couple of people were voicing the standard line in our culture. That is, when you fall ""out of love"" with someone, then that's it. You can't do anything about that because the love is gone! And I was saying, ""No, the feeling is gone. The emotion is gone. And what's more, by perservering and doing the right thing, you can bring that feeling back!"" In fact, I believe, stronger and deeper than it was before. And that's just one example of how actions have an impact on our feelings. There are many more. <h2>Prov. 4:23</h2> Again, back in Proverbsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. What he is saying here is something very similar. He's saying, ""Watch over your emotions. Guard them. Don't let them get carried awayÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Katey and the Tuna Salad incident? If you want to poison your life, just let these negative, bitter emotions go unchecked. Indulge them. Fantasize about them. Really feel the anger you have towards another person! And it's going to poison the well of your life. Again, I couldn't imagine giving people this advice if they didn't have a relationship with God. I look at my own self and realize, ""My emotions are the most powerful thing I have!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When I was a kid I used to bash my body on the ground and scream uncontrollablyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And then when I was a teenager that went away, because I was doing drugs. Then after my head cleared, those powerful emotions started to come back. They were scarey because I had no control over them at all. It's only been by going to God and saying, ""God! These things are bigger than me!"" that I have been able to get some victory here. And again, I don't claim to be in the clear. Because I believe that our emotions are extremely wild. But God has brought me a long way hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05034.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Relationships - Buck McCallum",

"Resolving Conflict: Conflicts of Position: Adults and Peers",1993-10-14,," <h1>Conflict of position</h1> Tonight we're concluding our series by talking about conflict that comes from the position you hold in relation to another person. For example, when someone is in authority over you, there is almost always a degree of tensionÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I think also, in some settings (perhaps settings where there is some competition), there is a degree of conflict with our peers. In other words, you can readily identify those who are above you. And you can identify those who are beneath you. But it's the people who are abreast of you that are hardest to relate to. Are they a threat? Will you wind up above them or below them? And this can lead to tension with your peers. Tonight we promised a movie, which we have. Keep in mind about our movies, they are intended for funÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (after movie) Obviously the point that we kept hitting again and again was that humans have an innate pridefulness, a desire to be in charge, that leads to conflict. It is true that we have learned in life there must be certain restraints, there must be social graces and agreements or else there would be anarchy. Some people have submitted to these agreements (probably most of us here), and some have not. But even among those of us who have submitted to the social contracts of authority, respect, etc., there is still tension. You will have tension between you and bosses, teachersÿ.ÿ.ÿ. You will have tension between you and peersÿ.ÿ.ÿ. What I want to talk about tonight is God's answer to those tensions. I want to assume that they exist. Although, I realize that for some of us here these conflicts may be less obvious than for others. Because I know that many of us are avoiders of conflict. So when tension comes up between us and peers, we retreat. When conflict comes up between us and authorities, we avoid it or quickly supress it. And more than one movie or book has been written on the premise that those among us who may seem to have the least amount of conflict, who may seem to be the most peaceable, have a war raging on the inside that sooner or later manifests itself. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: A classic like <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I want to assume that at many times in our lives there will be serious tension with other people based on the position they hold in relation to us. How does God look at this? <h1>God is sovereign</h1> First of all, I want to go back to something we talked about last week, when we discussed conflict with God. We made the point that conflict with God was tied to the notion of God's sovereignty. That means that God is in control of all things. God is so vast, and so infinite, he is able to know and have authority over each and every thing that happens in this world. Hence the conflict we talked about last week. If God is responsible for everything, and things go wrong, then we have a problem with God. <h2>With authority (Rom. 13:1)</h2> Well, this is certainly the case when it comes to the tensions we are talking about tonight. When it comes to authority, for example, a passage that is very clear on that is Rom.ÿ13:1ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This does not mean that God personally placed each and every Hitlerÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But it does mean that nobody gets in authority without God letting it happen. And God allowed it to happen. God knew about it. He sees it. He could prevent it, but he does not. So, that person's authority is there because God allows it to be. (I hesitate to use the word ""approved""ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.) <h2>With our peers (Pro. 15:25; Psa. 7:8-10; Psa. 146:9; 147:6; 2 Chron. 16:9)</h2> There is a frequent refrain in the Bible that if you are in a situation of danger, unfairness, threat, or competition, and your heart is for God?you trust in the Lord?then he will take care of you. That is his business. He wants to take care of us. He is interested in our well-being. He wants to vindicate those who are unfairly treated. He wants the best for you. To look at a few passagesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. These passages relate to God's sovereignty. They teach us that he is aware of each and every little situation that we are going through. And they also teach us about his good intentions for us. They teach us that he wants the best for us. To apply this in our relationships, what it means is that if there is an authority in our lives?even one that's unfair?God wants to see that we are taken care of. He wants to see that justice is done. And he wants the best for you in that situation. He has you in that situation because he loves you! Also, with peers this principle applies. With this person over here I'm competing with, I don't have to worry about who's going to wind up on top. If I somehow do better than that person, it will be because of God. If he winds up on top, again, it will be because God, in his love for me, said, ""I don't want you there right now."" What I'm recommending here is that the answer to our struggles and tensions is to have a very practical trust in God. He is in charge of your life and he wants the best for you (Rom.ÿ8:28). I should say at this point that this principle does not apply to everyone. There are many who have not given their lives to God. They have not put their faith in God. The Bible teaches us that there are some peple who have a relationship with God and some who don't, and the difference is one of choice. God offers us a choice. If you want a relationship with God, then you have to come to him and request the forgiveness of your sins. And you have to invite him to come into your lifeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>David's conscience</h1> There is a story from the life of David that really gets at what we're talking about right here. In this story, David comes right up to the edge of doing something really stupid, and that is vindicating himself?taking matters into his own hands. David, for those of you who don't know, was a king of Israel. But before he was a king, he was a shepherd. He was a shepherd who really loved the Lord. His relationship with the Lord was very intimate and personal. David wrote many of the Psalms that we have in our Bible today. Out of the blue one day God's prophet, Samuel, came and annointed David to be the next king. The only problem was, there was already a king in Israel. And that king wasn't David's father, he wasn't even distantly related to David. So you had a situation where David is just sitting there, and God comes to him and says, ""You are going to be king."" And that immediately puts a note of tension in his relationship with the current king. Especially because, before long, a series of events made it very clear to everyone that David was God's annointed. David was God's choice as the next king. This enraged the current king, king Saul. And he began to pursue David to try to kill him. This turned David into a renegade. He had a band of men he lived with and travelled with. There was an event that happened durring this time that tempted David to take matters into his own hands. <h2>Saul in the cave (1 Sam. 24)</h2> The setting is that Saul is actually out hunting for David, to kill him. He considers David a threat to the throneÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Well, if all things, Saul comes into this cave that David is in (high tension)ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. What I want you to notice is that David began to be convicted. He was convicted about what he had done. Even though he hadn't killed Saul, he had reached out his hand against him. And notice the reason he was conscience-stricken (v.ÿ6). Saul was the ""Lord's annointed."" But you see, David could say, 'So am I the Lord's annointed."" And he could see that Saul was trying to kill him. And he could see that Saul was a bad man. And he had all kinds of good reasons to plunge his sword right into Saul! But David's conscience on this matter was so sensitive that he realized even disrespecting king Saul, by cutting off the corner of his robe, was going too far. It was showing disrespect for God's annointed. It was taking matters into his own hands. The larger picture is that David knew, ""If God wants me to be king, then he'll make me king. If he wants to protect me, no guy named 'king Saul' can hurt me."" <h2>The principle: Our life is in God's hands</h2> There is a principle here that applies both to our relationships with authorities and to our relationships with peers. It is the principle that things are in God's hands. If he wants to remove this authority over me, he will. If he wants me to succeed more than my peers, he will see to that. <h1>Stories from my life</h1> I thought of stories from my own life where I've seen this at work. I have always been a very competitive person. I have always had a real hard time with authority. So I have lots of stories about tensions and conflicts in my life. <h2>The ""Bad, naughty Buck"" story</h2> I remember one time in my life when I was just getting involved in this church. I was just getting involved in the sense that I really wanted to walk with God. I had been involved with this church for years before, because my family is very involved here. So, the unfortunate thing is that I was this guy who was lurking around the church, but I was not interested in following God. I was a bad and naughty boy. Then that changed. I wanted to turn my life around and follow God. And the amazing thing about God is that he always forgives, acceptsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And when I turned my heart to him, he knew that I was sincere. But people can't tell these things. They see the same guy who caused all this trouble saying, ""Oh, but I want to turn my life around now!"" Some of them believe you and are happy. Some don't. It really bothered me that people were skeptical of me. Some of them were leaders in the church. Some of them were peers. Then, to make things worse, I continued to screw up. I would do something naughty. And the story would spread. That really bothered me. It didn't matter that the story was true. I felt it was maliciously spread by people who didn't like me. For me, my reputation and the stories spread about me and the distrust, were directly related to the kinds of things we've been talking about tonight. With my peers, I arrogantly thought, ""It's because they're threatened by me."" In the case of authorities, I thought they wanted to suppress me. But stories were spread about me?most of them true, some of them exaggerated. People didn't trust me. And all of this was a struggle for my pride. But as I got before the Lord and asked him, ""Why Lord? Why am I viewed with such suspicion? Why is my reputation so dark?"" The answer that came to me was, ""The person who's soiled laundry is hanging out has nothing to fear. He has nothing to hide."" I realized, ""God wants me in this position."" He wants to work on my humility. But even more than that, he wants to work on my honesty. I was a lurker. I was a deceiver. And in the midst of all the stories and distrust, it was like, ""What's the point of lying anymore? What's the point of trying to look good? I can be honest about myself because people think the worst about me anyway!"" That may sound like a terrible time for some of you. But that was such a healing time in my life. God taught me durring that time that the approval of other people was none of my business. My reputation was in his handsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But the principle that I want to get through to you is that when it comes to your relationship to other people, your relationship to authorities or your relationship to peers, these things are in God's hands. If you go through a period where you are being treated unfairly, ask God, ""What do you have to teach me durring this time?""ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>Key issues:</h1> It is the Lord who promotes me. It is the Lord who vindicates me. It is the Lord who allows people to be in authority over me.

"Christian Life: How God Reaches People",1994-02-18,,"  Acts 17:10-12 The Bereans <h1>They received the word with great eagernessÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and believed</h1> This is showing a connection between finding out the truth, and believing. Looking at the evidence and believing. This is the way many people become Christians. Why are people not Christians? (let them interract) It is not because the evidence is stacked up against Christianity, and there's just no good reason to believe. When people say they don't have enough reason to believe, that's great! They can have good reasons to believe, God provides it. When someone looks into the evidence for Christianity, it is very compelling. <h2>Let's talk about why you're here.</h2> Open up to input, call on peopleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I also know that many of you are here because you're supposed to be. Let's just think of a few questions that non-Christians ask: Have you ever heard that Jesus Christ was God? How do you know? Have you heard of an idea called the ""Trinity""? How do you know? Have you heard that a person cannot be saved by his good deeds? How do you know? I think it's clear that for most of us here, our faith depends on our mommies and daddies, or something your pastor told you. And in this respect many of you are at a real disadvantage because you came from Christian homes. I'll tell you something that's going to happen. You will see non-Christians come to Christ and they will know more about their faith than you do. They will know more about why they believe, why it's right, what their reasons are than you. And that's very concerning. Let me warn you about something, when you're at school, your mommy and daddy won't be there. When you go to college and they are saying the Bible is a mythical book, your pastor won't be there. It is a very common scenario to have Christian kids raised in Christian homes walk away from Christ when they get the chance because they never really knew why they believed. <h2>The nature of the evidence</h2> Let's talk about the nature of the evidence for Christianity. And let's think first about what we're talking about here. We're talking about issues like whether there is a God or not. We're talking about issues like where this universe came from. We're talking about what is going to happen to you when you die. We're talking about whether Christianity is true versus other religions. The nature of the evidence in these matters is not like some other things. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: How do we know, for example, that Joe Botti cleans every toilet seat he sits on with alcohol? We can watch him. We can talk to him about his fears of germs on his buttÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But with deeper issues, like eternity, are not like that. The evidence we have is not airtight. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's think of an illustration here. I want someone to come up and make a choice. I have two pieces of paper, and they represent two things that are going to happen to you. (If they choose one, a pile on by some huge guys. The other represents a kiss from a girl. But I won't tell him outright. I'll only beat around the bush.) There are two points I want to make about God and choosing Christianity. Number one, there is evidence. And I want to talk about the evidence in a bit. But the evidence points towards something. We can't bring God in here and examine him. We can't watch the movie of the beginning of the universe and find out where it came from. We can visit the afterlife and find out what it's like. But the second thing is you have to choose! Nobody in this life can not choose. If you don't choose, then that is a choice! This is something we have to be real clear with when we're talking with people. Because people think that they can just play the middle ground. There is no middle groundÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>What evidence is there?</h1> Now let's finish by talking about what evidence there is. <h2>Philosophical evidence</h2> When you're talking to someone who is not sure God is there, for example, what is their evidence? They haven't seen him. They haven't heard himÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But have they seen China? Have they seen ? The argument for something not being there is not a great one. To make it effectively you would have to be able to say, ""I've looked everywhere. I know everything. I've experienced everything. And I know that God does not exist."" Since it's impossible to do that, what most people say is, ""I'm not going to believe in God unless I see evidence."" That's where we say, ""I'm going to give you some evidenceÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The existence of the universe is one. It actually makes more sense to say that it came from somewhere than to say it came from nowhere. Everything around us has a cause. Can you think of anything that doesn't have a cause? It makes very much sense to say that the universe itself has a cause. That's why most scientist believe in Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Biblical evidence</h2> There is biblical evidence. By this I mean prophecy, the historical resurrection of Christÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This evidence is good for showing someone that Christianity's answers are better than other answers. You should know some prophecyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Experiential evidence</h2> This is one reason we share our testimonyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is why we have meetingsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05095.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",

"Parenting: Our Kids: Cultivating a Heart for Reaching Others for Christ",1994-04-13,,"  Cultivating a Burden in Your Kids <h1>Eli's sons</h1> One of the things that I fear about parenting, and specifically being a father, is the sin of Eli. I'm sure you guys are familiar with the sin of Eli. You've probably talked about in here before. But basically what happened was Eli was a servant of the Lord. He was the high priest of Israel. And one of his duties as a priest was to pass that burden of service on to his sons. What he passed on was the technology. He taught his sons how to go through the motions of being servants of God, but he didn't pass on a heart of sacrifice. His kids may have appeared to be servants of God the casual observer. But God saw their hearts and that they were selfish, that they used their position for personal gain, that they were taking advantage of the very people they were supposed to serve. My own burden here comes from my experience in Christian school. Almost all the kids there were proficient at doing the Christian thing, but most often the heart was not there. I was just a jerk on the other hand. But one thing that amazed me was later, as I started to get my own act together with the Lord, and I was involved in reaching my friends for the Lord, I went back to those old friends. To a man, none of them was interested in witnessing, studying the Bible, or doing anything spiritual. But I'm also burdened because I work with lots of Xenos kids in both the jr. high program and the high school program. Now a lot of the kids of Xenos parents really are burdened for the lost. They know about grace in their own life. They have a burden for others. They bring people. They pray for them. They try to talk to new people at meetings. But I have to tell you the truth, a lot of them don't. It's kind of severe sometimes, in fact, when our Christian kids are actually hostile to new, non-Christian visitors. Now I don't want to get negative about Xenos kids or kids who come from Christian homes. I want to talk positively about what we can do to pass on to our kids a heart for the gospel, a burden to serve, a burden to reach the lost. <h1>We have to have it ourselves</h1> Obviously the first thing in passing along any burden to you kid is you have to have it yourself. I can't assume that everyone here is empassioned about serving the Lord and reaching the lost. I know how that fire burns pretty dim in my own heart at times. So I want to talk first about our own lives as Christians and our own heart of service. I find myself getting more anxious as time goes on about the fact that I have only one life, and I want it to count. I feel like the Lord has been laying that on my heart more and more. And I feel like I've wasted so much time already. When I think about what life should count for, I think about sharing Christ with people. And I think about passing that passion on to other people, especially my daughter. This is a fire the Lord began to kindle in my heart through my own parents, especially my mother. And the Lord really stoked the flame with my first experiences of seeing my friends come to Christ. I went to Christian schools through jr. high. So I never witnessed to people at all. Non-Christians were like this mysterious mass of people out there. When I was thrown out of Christian school, I went into the secular high school and got into sin. And there was an impression in my mind that I think every kid has who is raised in a Christian home: Nobody is interested in this stuff. I remember being out with a friend of mine sledding one nightÿ.ÿ.ÿ. From there I started to get the feeling that more of my friends might also be interested. And they were. And they became Christians. And they grew. And my whole life was changed. My eyes were opened about the real meaning of life. I don't even know if all of us here have had the excitement of leading someone to Christ and helping them grow. But I know one thing; every single one of us here can be building a friendship with a non-Christian and looking for that opportunity. All of us should have one or two or three people we are building a friendship with at work, where we work out, in our neighborhoods. It's that kind of contact with non-Christians that kindles our fire. You see their neediness for Christ. You see how they struggle with their own family. You see that they really are hungry for spiritual things. I can suggest some other things that might increase your own burden for serving the Lord. Listen to tapes about missions, tapes about evangelism, tapes about the gospel. Pray that the Lord will give you the sense of urgency that we need to make our lives count. Without that kind of genuine heart for others, you're not going to pass it on to your kids. <h1>Passing it on</h1> Now let's talk about passing it on to your kids. I called up my mother for this one. Her record on this score seems to be pretty good. I know what I remember her doing with us, but I wanted to find out she was intentionally doing and what just kind of rubbed off. Because if you do have a heart for the Lord, it will rub off. But I think there are also some things we can intentionally do. <h2>View your whole life as service to God</h2> One thing that happens in Christian homes is that the parent's lives are dichotomized. We divide up the parts of our life: Here's the part where I serve God; Here's the part where I'm with my family; Here's the part where I'm at work, etc. And there's a very subtle message that comes accross when your life is divided up like that. From a kid's point of view, when we're together as a family then it's time to be into us. He's here for us. And there's all that world that's out there; it has nothing to do with us right now. I remember people coming into our home constantly. I remember both of my parents taking me with them to be involved in some ministry. I remember going along with my mother to give the gospel in churches where most people were non-Christians. Her ministry was brought into our home. Her ministry was a part of my life too. If you can't do it in the home, then you need to take them with you. If you dichotomize your life, then it just makes the kids selfish. Because the family is so private and closed off. Another side effect of this dichotomized life is the kids view ministry as something that takes their parents away. They're detached from it and have no burden for it. And all they know is that it takes their parents away. Now, I firmly believe that there needs to be times of personal and exclusive attention to your family. We need to get time alone with our wives, kidsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So I'm not promoting no personal family time. What I am promoting is getting your kids involved in your own ministry. Another angle on this is involving yourself in your kid's ministry. My mother used to have Bible studies for us kids when we were small, and invite neighborhood kids. She would have projects to do, etc. And she would often reach the parents through the kids. Take your kids with you as soon as you can. I remember my mother took us to adult conferences on subjects like prophecy, sex, etc. She took us to the groups she worked on. <h2>Share your struggles and needs with your kids</h2> Secondly, share your thoughts, struggles and burdens about your own ministry with your kids. When you're reaching out to someone in the neighborhood, tell your kid about it. Have them pray with you about it. I remember my mother taking me to these Bible studies and on the way sharing her fears with me. She'd say, ""So and so is going to be there and I'm worried. I think he may be hostile to the gospel. Let's pray before we go in."" Or, ""Satan has really been trying to stop me from this work and I'm feeling really inadequate. I need you to pray with me that I won't be afraid."" My mother needed me! She leaned on me. After we would come out of a study, she would share her discernments with me. She would tell me who she thought was listening and how excited she was. She would share some of the struggles she saw people having and how burdened she was. Those kinds of things made a deep impression on me. <h2>Teach your kids stewardship</h2> I think another thing we can do is teach our kids about stewardship. What I mean by that is 1ÿCor.ÿ4:7, ""What do you have that you did not receive?"" My mother was very encouraging with me. I remember her pointing out, ""Scot, you are very intelligent."" Or, ""Scot, you're a leader of people."" And she would always say, ""That is a trust from God. That is an obligation. Not everyone has the smarts God gave you. When he gives one person something, he gives it to share with others."" Tell your kids, ""Your looks are a tool God has given you. You're good looking. And you should be thankful. But I'm telling you now that if you take an ability like that and just use it for yourself, that's a crime. You should use it for the Lord's service. Use it as a tool to get your foot in the door with people and share Christ."" ""You are a great manipulator of people! You can get people to do what you want. And it's not an evil thing. That's a gift from God! But if you use it for your selfish desires, then it's a sin. You have to turn that ability over to God"" ""You are a strong willed kid. You are rebellious. And no matter what anyone tells you, that is a gift from God. But the problem will come up when you don't let him use that strength."" These kinds of messages can be communicated from a very young age. You know what your kid's strenths are. You boast about them all the time. And that's great! Boast about them in front of your kid, in a way that shows you know where those gifts came from. Give them a sense of responsibility. I think this also applies to money. You've got to be open about how you give, how much you give and why you give. And you've got to teach your kids to give. Make them part with their money. You'll find that they actually get quite a bit of joy out of it. <h2>Encourage your kids to take risks</h2> Finally, we can encourage our kids to take risks themselves. <h2></h2>",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05376.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Parenting - Buck McCallum",
"Colossians 2: The Cross and Human Guilt",1994-06-02,," Colossians 2:13, 14 <h1>The cross has an unpopular message</h1> Tonight we're looking at a couple verses that are fantastic for explaining the cross of Jesus Christ. They've been favorites of mine for years because of some of the imagery that Paul uses to convey what Christ did at the cross. Recently I was at the S.C. getting my supply of tapes to listen to, and there was a series of tapes on the cross of Christ. And I thought, ""That is so great! I've got to have those!"" Because it is a topic that is so un-trendy. It's so stripped-down and basic. But in that series I learned again that the cross is the answer to guilt. The cross is the answer to loneliness. The cross is the answer to meaning in life. So much media-hype, money and ink is wasted over trendy, six-month solutions to these problems. The cross of Jesus Christ is kind of a laughably stark to all these problems. I want to consider the biggest problem the cross addresses, guilt. And I want to consider the notion of guilt in today's culture. There is so much energy being expended today to explain that we are not really guilty, that we aren't really to blame, that we are victims of this, that or the other thing. (Read stories of victimization from Newsweek and Time. Some good ones.) In all this hubbub, we have a pretty unpopular message to bring: You are guilty. You are responsible. And you will be held accountable. Those ideas are pure heresy in our culture. You can be taken on the talk-shows and lynched for saying that kind of stuff. But the message of the cross is exactly that. Jesus died for us because our guilt is so vast we could do nothing about it. The answer to guilt we find in the cross is not ""I'm OK, You're OK."" The answer is, ""Jesus Christ died for you and me, because we're not OK."" It's such an extreme message of our sinfulness on the one hand, and God's powerful love for us on the other hand. <h1>ÿWe are guilty (v. 13, 14)</h1> First of all, it says that we were dead spiritually. That means we were in an alienated state from God?hostile to God. Then it says we were ""in the uncircumcision of our sinful nature."" He is not referring to the actual rite of circumcision here. He is using it as a metaphor. Circumcision stood for being unique and set apart for God. It was a rite that simply meant you were God's possession. So here Paul is saying that previously you were separate from God. Far from being his possession, you were alienated from him, hostil towards him, in a state of war. He says the answer to this is that God made us alive with Christ, and forgave our sins. How did he do this? I love the imagery of this next verse. He says there was a certificate with charges against us. The image is of a multi-page indictment. Actually it was beyond an indictment, this is the verdict. These charges were, ""You <em>are</em> guilty of this. You <em>are</em> guilty of thatÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" And he says it was against us. This list of charges was against us. We were guilty. But he took the whole list and nailed it to the cross. What was the cross about? The cross was about my guilt, my sin?the sin I am responsible for, that I choose. Jesus Christ was actually judged and punished for that sin! <h1>We minimize the sin part</h1> There's a danger in our culture, and maybe it's always been a danger, of sterilyzing the cross of this part of the message. We want to take the guilt and the fact that we deserve condemnation out of the picture. From Horton's <em>Beyond Culture Wars</em>, ""Even the cross itself is no longer the way God dealt with my guilt toward him and his condemnation toward me, but is rather the way God shows me how much I'm worth and that should keep me from feeling guilty and condemning myself."" There's a subtle twist here, when the sin, guilt and deserved condemnation are taken out of the picture. Yes, the cross shows how much God loves me. Yes, the cross shows how much I matter. But also, the cross shows how hopelessly guilty I am. I have seen the fruit of this many times in the lives of Christians who have supposedly received God's forgiveness, they have turned to the cross of Christ for forgiveness. And yet many Christians have very little awareness that they were even guilty in the first place! Or we have very little sense for how grevious our guilt was before God. This passage here is saying there was a document, a list of charges against you that was hostile towards you. It said, ""You must die. You are guilty enough to go to hell."" <h1>The price of minimizing</h1> The price of this minimizing is that we don't appreciate God's love. There are a lot of Christians who are floundering in their Christian life, and I'm convinced it's a problem with square one: They don't understand what it's all about. They don't understand their guilt, their sin, and the fact that it is completely outrageous God is relating to them at all. They take it as a given that God would forgive them. This was the essence of the conflict that swirled around Jesus Christ. With religious people he was obviously cool and aloof! But he was a friend of sinners. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It was Zaccheaus, who climbed a tree because he had to see this guy who talked about forgiveness so much. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was people like the woman who washed his feet with her tears because she couldn't believe he would forgive her. There were people who were close to Jesus, and there were people who were distant. And the difference was how much they appreciated his message of forgiveness. This is why God has to let us go through things that will open our eyes. Christians often relate that they see themselves as more of a sinner now than before they became a Christian. The reason is not that they sin more (except in some cases). The reason is that their eyes are open more now. They see something they didn't see before, and that is how much of a sinner they really are. One of the most graphic descriptions of Paul's sin comes towards the end of his life (read Titusÿ3:3). This is without a doubt the most graphic description of Paul's sin. And I'm sure it comes as a result of seeing more and more about himself. There's something I hear on the lips of almost every Christian I've talked to about their relationship with God. ""I don't <em>experience</em> God's love very much,"" or something like that. I hope you'll see from our discussion tonight that there's something huge standing in the way of that. And it's not God's refusal to love you. It's our refusal to see our sins. It's our desire to minimize our sins. And when we do that we shrink the grace and love of God into something very small.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05357.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 2002 - Buck McCallum",

"Colossians 3: How To Interact with One Another",1994-06-23,," <h1>Intro</h1> I'm going to continue on in our study of Colossians by looking at Col. 3:16. If you'll recall a couple weeks ago when Todd and I talked it was about how God changes us. We talked about how important it is to experience God's forgiveness first of all. No one has a relationship with God until they receive the gift of his forgivenessÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But when we do have a relationship with God, he views us as new people, completely forgiven, completely accepted and lovedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And it's in this context that people can really changeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. We concluded with some thoughts about what God begins to change with us in vv.ÿ6ff. We pointed out that the majority of changes God brings about in our life have to do with how we relate with people. He teaches us how to love, which is the central need in a person's life, as well as our greatest weakness. What we're looking at tonight are some thoughts about how we ought to interract with each other and the role of our meeting together, like this and other meetings. <h1>The word of Christ</h1> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. Let's talk about what this means and what it doesn't mean. First of all, Jesus Christ is portrayed in the Bible as the member of the Trinity who communicates to us. He communicates to us by coming and living among humans as God in the flesh. By what he did and taught he communicated God's nature to us. But beyond Christ becoming a human, the word of Christ is also recorded in the Bible. The teaching of Christ's apostles embodies the teaching of Christ. For example, as an application of what Paul is talking about here, in Actsÿ2:42 Luke tells us that the early Christians used to gather daily and devote themselves to the apostles teaching. Paul also viewed himself as directly commissioned by Christ to communicate his word. If you read later in this book, for example, he instructs them to read this letter publicly and then make sure that other churches in the area get it also. So, for us today, the application of this instruction has to do with the scriptures. He goes on and says, ""Let the word of Christ dwell in you."" The term ""dwell in you"" simply means that the word of Christ lives in you. It's alive in you. It's not a temporal or fleeting thing, like a moment of inspirition. You've made room in your life for the word of Christ. Then term ""richly"" means that you are wealthy. It refers to people who have a lot, like kings and rulers. He's saying that our possession of God's word, the scriptures, ought to be like that. We should be rich in our kowledge of the scriptures. This would not mean that you have a weekly encounter with God's word, or that you hear someone teach it to you once a week. For many Christians, they would consider that a healthy dose of God's word. ""Hey, I go to church once a week!"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's just consider, what does it take to get rich with money? Sure, every now and then someone wins the lottery (just enough to keep suckers coming back week after week). But I know of no spiritual counterpart to the lottery. The way you get rich spiritually is the same way most people get rich today, you have to earn it. A once-a-week dinner that someone prepares for you would be a starvation diet by anyone's measure. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say most Christians are dirt-poor when it comes to God's word. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Through the years I've shared with people some of the lengths I've gone to in order to become wealthy in God's word. I know I still feel the need to grow here and have been very convicted about that lately. I'll share with people how hard I've worked at memorizing. Or I'll show them my library, or share some of the studies I've undertaken. And I'll get this look from people where I can tell what they're thinking. ""That's you, not me."" Why? Because they're thinking, ""You're a teacher! I'm not! And I don't intend to be, at least on the scale that you are."" Let me tell you, first of all, that I have not conceived of myself that way, especially early on. I thought of myself as an average Christian. And I viewed the level of work I put in on the scriptures, on reading books, etc., as normal for every Christian. I viewed it as God's will, God's command to me, an average Christian. Because I knew passages like this one that said I should be wealthy in the word of Christ. But let's hold on to that distinction between teachers and non-teachers for just a moment. I'm going to show you something that may amaze you. I want to conclude this section with some practical thoughts on how you can become deeper and richer in your knowledge of Christ's word. For one, I know most of you have been involved in study groupsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The emphasis in these groups is to get you to do the work of studyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Secondly, classes are frequently offered hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Third, you should be reading books. This is one of the riches sources I know of, and it happens all too little. Me and some other people have been working on a reading listÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>Teaching and admonishingÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> The fourth piece of practical advice is right here in the passage. Paul says, ""as you teach and admonish each other. What he's doing here is describing one way that the word of Christ can grow inside of you. As you teach and admonish one another, both you and the person you are teaching grow in your knowledge of God's word. Now I said I wanted to hold on to that idea that there are only some people who are teachers of God's word. That's not what I see here. I see Paul telling the entire church to be involved in teaching, at one level or another. Granted, perhaps not all of us should be able to do something like I'm doing right now. But you should be able to teach others God's word. Here's a way of relating that we don't see much in the world around us. We don't see one person saying to another, ""Hey, let me teach you about life,"" or ""Will you teach me?"" For many people that would be virtually insulting. And yet, in the church God wants us to have the humility towards one another where we can teach and be taught by others. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember the first time I was introduced to this notion there was this guy who very simply said to me, ""I'd like to get together with you and study the scriptures together."" And my reaction was, ""Wow! That's great!"" I was excited. I looked forward to it. And I'll bet that it was scarey for him to bring that up. I'll bet he wondered, ""What's Buck going to say? Will he be offended? Will he even want to?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've done it the other way too, where I initiated being taught. I remember going to one guy and asking him, ""Hey, I don't know much about the Holy Spirit. Could we get together and study that topic?"" Or there was another guy I remember virtually harassing, ""Teach me how to study the Bible!"" And I can remember grabbing him after a meeting after he'd kind of put me off a couple times and saying, ""What about right now? We've got time right now we could go somewhere and study!"" And we did. And it was exciting. I'm just giving you these examples from my life because I know how it felt. But I've often considered myself a poor student. I've looked at other people who have worked much harder than me and been challenged and convicted. But I know from experience that it is actually good to offer to teach someone the scriptures. And it's good to be taught the scriptures. It is a great way of spending time with someone. And it can often lead to deeper personal relating. I really think this is the kind of thing that should be happening more oftenÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: And it doesn't have to be one person teaching another. I remember my wife and I were involved in a study with another couple where we were more or less peers. And the way we handled it was to take turns. Each week a different one of us would come in with something prepared to teach the others. And it was a great time. So I think this is something we could really stand to add to our times together. Admonishing is a term that simply means to correct someone. And again we don't see this kind of thing going on in the world around us. We see people growling at each other when they are personally offended. But we don't see one person looking at another and saying, ""I see something in her life I think I could help her with."" That's the kind of loving concern that should be going on here. And when Paul says, ""with all wisdom,"" he's referring to what we talked about earlier, namley, you have to have something to say. You need to be rich in the word of God so you have something to say. You've got to have something to say. There are a lot of people who like the idea of teaching someone else. They aren't shy about that. But they don't have much to say. That's a problem. <h1>As you sing songsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> I want to conclude with a thought that's kind of scarey for some of us here. Paul says that yet another way that the word of Christ can dwell within us is through Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. These are things that not many of us are involved with here. In fact, when I start to sing spiritual songs I'm often scoffed at or told to shut up. Here is a way of relating to each other and God that we don't get into that much. And I think it's to our detriment. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was talking to Matt last week about this kind of stuff and how we don't get into it and he made an interesting comment that I think is true. He said that if we got into this kind of stuff more, more people would be moved to give their lives to God. I think there's truth to that. On the one hand I think a person needs to think through his relationship to God, consider it, grapple with the truth. And there's a lot said about that in the Bible. Paul says in Rom.ÿ12:2 to give ourselves to God as a living sacrifice, because it's <em>reasonable</em>. It makes sense to give your life to the God of the universe, who loves us and has the answers to life. But there is another dimension to us, the emotional and the experiential. And they have quite an effect on us as humans. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: A couple weekends ago Amy and I were up in Chicago and we went to the Gospel Fest. They had some of the best singers and choirs from all over the country there. And it was a moving experience to here these people sing about how God is worthy. How God is so good. How God is so loving. It's powerful. And it creates a response in me. It always has. I don't know what the answer for us here is. But I know that one step we should all be taking is to join in the prayer meeting we have every week. We try to make a point there of having a time where we praise the Lord and thank him. And for me those times of prayer can often have the same effect.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05359.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Colossians - 2002 - Buck McCallum",

"Christian Life: Christ's radical view of the Meaning of Life",1994-08-19,,"  <h1>Questions</h1> There are two questions I want to deal with from the teachings of Christ. The first isÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Is there anything really worth living for? Could I ever make a difference? <h2>Have you ever asked anyone?</h2> Have you ever asked anyone what do you live for? What is your life about? What's the purpose of your life? What kind of responses do you get? I'll tell you the most common one I get. ""I don't think about that stuff, man."" Or some variant of it. ""I'm too busy thinking about what I'm going to do this weekend!"" This topic makes people feel uncomfortable. Why? (Because they don't think there is a good answer to those two questions. They're afraid of the answer to those questions.) What do you do when you think there might not be anything really worth living for? What do you do when you think in the back of your mind that you may not be able to make a difference? You set your sights lower! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's suppose you're a girl here. And you want to go out with some stud, like Ben. But you think that probably Ben won't notice you. So, instead you settle for someone like Uriah or Gabeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is what people do about meaning in life. Why is the whole culture agreed on the fact that there is nothing better to do than have fun? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: If I told you, ""I guarantee you can have worldwide impact, impact that will last for eternity!"" How many people would say, ""Well, I don't know if I'm interested in that. I think I'd rather just have fun."" Only a fool! <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I have wanted to have fun in this life. Anyone who knows me knows that. But if there's been anything I've prayed to God on a consistent basis since I was your age or younger it was, ""God, I want my life to count for something. Please God, let my life matter!"" <h1>We're not worthy (Luke 5:4-11)</h1> I want to talk about a vision, a purpose in life from the words of Christ. This story comes at the beginning of Jesus' ministry when he called the disciples to follow him. I kind of want to go to the end of the story first and see what these guys did (read v.ÿ11). There's something here Luke wants us to see. He emphasizes it. He doesn't just say they followed him. Yeah, sure they followed Christ. What he emphasizes is they <em>left everything</em> and followed him. What was it about Jesus' call that they said, ""I'm going to leave everything and follow this guy?"" And the story is given more punch by what comes before (read 4-10). These guys were fishermen. I don't know if any of you are serious fishermen, but I am. There's the kind of fishing it seems most people get into where you put a worm on the bobber and sit there all afternoon, which was something I could never understand. And it's why I never even bothered fishing until I was about 22 or 23. Then this guy gave me this book about how to hunt for fish. It introduced me to the idea that there is a way of fishing that is very aggressive?hunting and stalking the fish, not waiting for them to come to you. These guys knew about all that. They were pros. And when they got into a big haul of fish like this there was a double thrill. They were not only saying, ""Whoa! This is the big catch boys!"" They also knew this was big money. They were pulling up hundreds and hundreds of dallars worth of fish. You know these guys were whooping and holleringÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Look at Peter's reaction. ""Go away from me, for I am a sinner!"" What does this mean? Is this a reaction you would have? I can picture myself there. I might go up and say something like, ""Jesus! You are the best! Thanks a lot!"" But Peter comes up and saysÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Why? (He doesn't understand why God has blessed him in this way. He doesn't think he is worthy. He's just a regular guy, a fisherman. And who is he to be blessed in this way?) Can you see the connection here to our second question? Inside all of us is a fear that we are unworthy. Especially when it comes to the question ofÿ really making an impact in this life, there is the fear that we can't, or won't be able to. And it's a realistic fear. We are sinners. We are small. I am just one small person in this huge world. But the reason you can make an impact is not because of something about you. It's not because you are worthy. It's not because you are great. It's because God wants to bless you. That's the only reason. That's good news. If you had to be good enough to be blessed by God, we'd be in trouble. If you had to be gifted enough to make a huge impact, the odds are still against you. But because it's God who says, ""Come here, I want to bless you,"" then all the sudden it's possible! It's realistic! I want to turn now to what Jesus said that made these guys <em>leave everything</em> and follow him. <h1>Catching men</h1> Jesus says, ""Don't be afraid, from now on you'll be catching men!"" First he says, ""Don't be afraid."" Any ideas on why he said this? (Because it was a fear that Peter was expressing. It was the fear we've been talking about that everyone shares, ""I'm not worthy. I'm not good enough."") But Jesus says, ""I know what you're thinking. And I've got more for you than these fish. I'm going to turn you on to catching humans!"" Here is an interesting idea?catching humans. Let's talk about that some. <h2>The hook: The gospel</h2> Just a quick poll of ideas here, what do you think it means to catch humans? Evangelism is not the only issue. What does your memory verse for today say? Does it say to evangelize people? No it doesn't. It says to disciple them. It's great to see someone receive the free gift of forgiveness. What could be better? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: We were talking about that last night. Imagine someone you shared the gospel with, meeting that person in heaven! There's meaning in life right there! <h2>Make disciples</h2> But there's more. When he says make disciples of people he's talking about shaping their life. People need help. People need to change. People have problems. People almost never amount to the potential God sees for them. That's why Christ used the term ""disciple."" It speaks of taking someone and teaching them to have their whole life shaped by Christ. Let's just get a visual of how we do that here (chart of conversion to commitment). <h2>The exciting part</h2> Here's the exciting part. I told you that you could have worldwide impact in this life. But none of you really believed me. Let's suppose you did this with someone once every 5 years. Not an outrageous number. Then after those five years you both did it with someone else. And after the next five years all four of you did it with someone elseÿ.ÿ.ÿ. After 50 years you would have impacted 2048 people. Very possible many of these people would be in different churches, different cities, different parts of the world by the time you die. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Already I've had the priviledge of having input with people who are now working for Christ in other parts of the country and even the world. I am blown away that God let's me have that kind of impact. I'm just a regular guy! I'm not worthy! There is something worth living for. <h1>Application</h1> Here's what I want you guys to consider: Do you want your life to really count for something or not? If Christ said, ""Come here, I want to shape you and turn you into a person who could have worldwide impact that lasts for eternity,"" would you come? Would you leave everything?

"Marriage: Male-Female Relationships Part 1",1994-09-15,,"  <h1>Relevant Scriptures</h1> <h2>1 Thess. 4:3-6</h2> Don't defraud; sexuality <h2>1 Cor. 16:14</h2> Let all that you do be done in love. <h2>1 Cor. 13:4-7</h2> Against jealousy as a basis for a relationship <h2>Gal. 3:28</h2> Neither male nor femaleÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Should argue against distinctions in the church. <h2>1 Cor. 12:21</h2> ""I have no need of you"" to argue against separation. <h2>Gen. 2:23-25</h2> <h2>Gen. 2:18</h2> <h1>Intro</h1> By popular demand, we're going to be talking for a few weeks about male/female relationships. Dating doesn't really describe what we're talking aboutÿ.ÿ.ÿ. As I see it, there is a great divide, as with all human relationships. But the more different we are, the greater the divide. The chasm between men and women was something that God predicted in the Bible. Back when Adam and Eve decided they wanted to go their own way apart from God. God came and visited them with some troublesome words. <h2>Genesis 3:16</h2> There's a background here. The first humans were under God's protective care. They decided to throw off the yoke of God's authority. And so God says there's gonna be some troubles coming your way if you don't want me around. One of those troubles is going to be pain in childbirth. He also tells Adam that he's going to be at war with a hostile environment?that things aren't going to come easy. But the part of this I want to focus on is the last phrase, ""You will desireÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" What he's saying is that you will have a desire for closeness, but instead he will rule over you. Is that ominous or what? This is exactly what we see played out in the pages of history. In a world where each person is for himself, then it's a question of who can dominate who. And how can I protect myself from others? What a contrast between this an just a few verses earlier, where this couple is portrayedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (2:25) Here's the picture of vulnerability, openness, nothing to fear. Instead it's turned into suspicion, fear, who can rule over who, self-protection. <h2>There is an ideal (Gal. 3:28; 1 Cor. 12:21)</h2> There is an ideal in the NT, where God wants to set things right. All the divisions between people, he wants to do away with them. As it says in Gal. 3:28ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And beyond that, in the church, God wants us to get to the point where we see our need for everyone. In the church, God wants us to view each other as if we were members of a body?as if I were a hand, you were an armÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And in that light, Paul says in 1ÿCor. 12ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Here is the ideal, that there be no distinctions between us, that we all recognize how much we need each other. Gospel? <h2>The truth isÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> But what is the reality? Even in the church, there is still suspicion. There is still great confusion and a lot of distance. What I want to talk about tonight is moving towards that ideal with people of the opposite sex. Show continuum from friendships to marriage. What I want to talk about is the value of establishing friendships and dating relatioships with the opposite sex that will draw us close together. And we're also going to talk about some common things that happen that harden us and actually drive a wedge between ourselves and members of the opposite sex. <h1>Do everything out of love (1 Cor. 16:14)</h1> The first premise we'll opperate from here is that love should rule. For the Christian, love is not something you reserve for a special time, or a special place, or even a special someone. Love is a way of life. It's something supernatural that only God can bring about in our lives. This is really a necessary foundation we have to lay here because nothing makes sense without God's view of love. <h2>1 John 3:16</h2> Let's start with a concise picture of love from 1 Johnÿ.ÿ.ÿ. John says it's that simple. And it really is: Jesus Christ died for people who hated him (Romans 5:10). Jesus Christ didn't have to give his life for us. His self-image didn't depend on it. His insecurity didn't drive him to it. He chose to do it because it would be the best thing for us (John 10:18). Jesus Christ didn't feel very good about dying for us. I bring this up because it flies in the face of our picture of love?that love is this powerful feeling. Jesus had a powerful feeling when he gave his life for us allright, and it was a bad feeling. Yet, it was the epitome of love. Jesus Christ didn't want to die for us. Here's one that might surprise you. Jesus on the one hand, chose to come and give his life for us. He volunteered. But when he got up to the edge, his will melted within him. We may be talking about a feeling here. But what Jesus said that night before he gave his life is, ""God, if it is your will, take this away from me! Yet, not my will, but your will be done!"" He got to the point where in order to love us, he had to do what he didn't want to do! Let's just try to imagine this: Imagine people who love you even when you hate them, who love you not because they need you and are insecure without you, but because you are you, who love you when they don't feel like it, who love you even when they don't want to! Wouldn't that be great! Imagine how this would deal with our fears and insecurities! Imagine what great relationships we could have! Now, I want you to take this whole picture and just erase it. Because you will not find this. Nor should you look for it. You can't find a place in the Bible where it tells us, ""This is what you need! You need someone to love you like this!"" What you will find is 1ÿJohnÿ3:16, ""You go out and love others like this."" <h1>What would it be like?</h1> Let's consider what friendships and dating would be like with the opposite sex if you?not the other person, just you?were loving like this. <h2>Initiating</h2> First of all, when you initiate with someone of the opposite sex, you would actually be interested in them. I want to find out about this person. I want to serve this person. In contrast, how do things get started between men and women normally? Can I get someone interested in me? And as you walk up to talk to someone, ""What does he think about me? Am I impressing her? Am I going to be rejected? Am I going to be hurt?"" Someone may say, ""I hear what you're saying Buck, but I just can't get over my self-centeredness here. It's just too hard for me to initiate in a selfless way."" You can say that to yourself. But don't try to persuade me of that. I've seen God at work too much. I've seen God set me free to talk to people of the opposite sex, people of the same sex who intimidate me, stand up hereÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Don't try to persaude me of that. God can change anyone. It's not like I don't struggle with self-centeredness. It's not like I don't struggle with my fears. We all do. But with prayer, and taking risks in faith that God will help us, we can overcome our self-centered approach to others that causes so much fear. One other thing about this, if we're approaching things from the biblically loving standpoing, it makes relationships between men and women so much more natural. If God can turn you into the type of person who gets out of himselfÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (By the way, I've seen people claim they have victory in this area, but it's only with the opposite sexÿ.ÿ.ÿ.) What will happen is you will have friendships with people of the opposite sex. And it's in that context that you can see potentials for going deeper. People hear that and say, ""OK. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to pursue a friendship with her."" What's happened? Someone has thought they are going to use this notion of ""selfless love"" as a technique to get what they want?a romantic relationship! What I'm saying is that we need to pray that God will help us practice his love in the area of initiating with others. And we need to take risks. And we need to do it with lots of people. <h2>Friendship</h2> OK, now you're initiating with people in a way that you're trying to get your eyes off of yourself. Now what? Now you have to be a friend to someone. Here's the way it is with the opposite sex: There is a level you can go to where all the sudden there is an emotional bond. This isn't the kind of thing I can prove to you in the Bible. Except in Gen.ÿ2, the author comments that the goal of marriage is that the two become one. Apparently God has made males and females to be complimentary somehow, somehow magnetic or attracting to one another. At some point between two people of the opposite sex, that attraction begins to set in. Sometimes it doesn't! Which is amazing. I don't know if you've ever had a relationship with someone of the opposite sex where the emotional bond doesn't ever set in, even though you spend quite a bit of time together. I find that fascinating when it happens. (But it's tricky. Because I've been in relationships where I thought it wasn't happeningÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and then it happens! Overnight!) What do you do in a friendship? This is where so many people get lost. ""Let's try and heat up these emotions I feel!"" ""Let's kiss!"" So many people don't understand how to apply love to a friendship! They only know, ""I want this feeling to be stronger!"" What do you do in your friendships with the opposite sex? You do what John said. You try to figure out how to lay down your life for them. You try to figure out how to serve that person. You try to figure out how you can benefit that person. You try to figure out how God can use you in that person's life. Let me give you some examples of things you might begin to do if you practiced godly love in your friendships: <h3>Discover</h3> You can't very well serve someone if you don't understand them. So you begin to learn about them. What makes them tick? What is their background? What are their strengthsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>Be open</h3> Selfish love is self-protective. Selfish people play a lot of games and you have to fight through a lot of facades. Real love practices openness and honesty. You're not as worried about ""How's someone going to hurt me?"" as you are about being real with that person. <h3>Serve</h3> You need to begin to discover where this person needs to grow. What kind of issues is she struggling with? How can I pray for her? You can find these things out by questions, observation, prayerÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And when you set about to serve someone, you sit down with them and say, ""I've been thinking about youÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Apply these lessons elsewhere</h2> Next week we're going to talk about going further in a male-female relationship to where there's an emotional bond. Call it datingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But I want leave you with this thought. If you pursue these things and see some success, then practice them elsewhereÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05437.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Marriage &amp; Dating - Buck McCallum",
"Marriage: Male-Female Relationships Part 2",1994-09-22,,"  <h1>The foundation: love</h1> We laid a foundation for relationships last week that is very importantÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Love is the basis of relationships. But we saw that God's love is completely different than ours. We read in John how God's love is perfectly typified by Jesus giving his life for us. We saw that when Jesus Christ gave his life for us, he didn't feel like itÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Last week we looked at initiating relationships. We looked at the notion of having friendships with the opposite sex. We saw these qualities of love have a bearing on how we would initiate and carry on a relationship with the opposite sex. I think one thing that was fascinating last week was that in almost every area, real love is the opposite of our love. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In initiation, real love focuses on getting to know the other person rather than trying to impress them. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: In the area of emotions, real love focuses onÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>Four realities in dating relationships</h1> Now I want to talk about going deeper in male/female relationships. Call it dating, getting serious, whatever. We're talking about that point where be kind of exclusive and not date anyone else but that person. Let's begin by establishing several realities of dating relationships. <h2>People will date</h2> The first reality is that people will date. I say this because there are some idealistic Christians that wonder if people should date. ""It's not in the Bible,"" they say. They didn't even do it in Jesus' time. And there are a lot of painful and negative things often associated with dating. Here's the reality. People will date. And because it's not some kind of a moral issue, we need to figure out how to do it in a way that's not going to be damaging <h2>There is an emotional bonding</h2> The second reality of dating relationships is that there is some kind of emotional bonding between the two people. Like we said last week, there's something that goes on between people of the opposite sex where there's an attractionÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>Most romantic relationships terminate</h2> A third reality is that most dating relationships end. The younger you are, the more likely the relationship you are in will end. <h2>There is pain in separation</h2> And finally, when it does end there will be pain. These are four realities of dating relationships that I don't see changing anytime soon. What we have to do is look at godly love and see how it applies to this framework of dating. And there are several principles of biblical love that I believe apply here. <h1>Love does not take advantage (1 Thess. 4)</h1> The first principle of love we can apply to dating is that love does not take advantage of another for personal gain. In other words, if I love a person, I don't use that person. Love is giving. Love is self-sacrificing and serving. Paul says in 1 Cor. 13:5 very simply, ""Love is not self-seeking."" <h2>We take in many ways</h2> There are all kinds of ways we can take advantage of another person. There are all kinds of ways we can use another person. And if you've dated a lot, you've probably done most of them. <h3>We can use a person for identity and security</h3> You can date someone just because you feel insecure not dating someone. ""What would people think of me?"" There's a question of identity there. <h3>We can use a person emotionally.</h3> We can use a person emotionally. You can see this when one or both parties are coming together and they've got to get an emotional charge. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's not, ""I've been thinking about her, and I think she needs some encouragement!"" It's, ""I wonder how hot I can get things tonight."" We've got to be in touch with our motives on this kind of stuff. We need to reflect on our time together. What was my attitude? What was I trying to do when I got together with her? Was it, ""I though about her ahead of time. I've thougth about what she needsÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" Or was it, ""Man, I can't wait for tonight! There's going to be some strong feelings!"" And you walk away from a relationship where that kind of thing went on and you feel emotionally used! Like I said last week, God's ideal is that men and women get closer. But what happens instead? Because of our selfishness, because of our screwed up ideas of what love is, we hurt each other and grow more and more self-protective. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: What happens to a person as they get older? Do they get more open, vulnerable, easy to get close to? No way! People get more careful, more closed off, harder to get to knowÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And why is this? Because people have been used again and again and again! So there are selfish patterns of relating that drive people apart. And there are godly patterns of love that bring people together. <h3>We can use a person sexually</h3> Obviously we can use a person sexually. One of the strongest passages on this is 1ÿThess.ÿ4:4-7. I like the way Paul puts it here because of the reasons he gives. He says that sexual passion in the wrong context can ""defraud"" your brother. When you defraud someone you are conning them out of something. You are ripping them off. You defraud someone by trying to get something from them by illegitmately offering something in return. It may be sex, security, whatever. Sex is probably the main way we defraud one another because sex says, ""I want to be completely united with you. I don't want to hold anything back."" And yet, the very nature of a dating relationship is that it's temporary! In a dating relationship we are holding quite a bit back. We are holding back our commitment, our future, etc. Paul says in 1ÿCor.ÿ6:16 that the one who has sex with a prostitute is one with her. He unites himself somehow to a prostitute! And he even cites the scripture from the OT about marriage, ""The two shall become one,"" from Gen.ÿ2. He's saying that even in the most casual sexual encounter there is some kind of bonding, some kind of oneness that results. And then we walk away. Or we break up. With our sex we're saying, ""I want oneness. I want complete unity and commitment."" But then we walk away. This is why Paul says, ""Watch out that you don't defraud one another by sexual immorality!"" There is real damage that results from this. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's suppose that there was a person in your life you had to pass all the time. And every time you walked past this person, they snapped you in the ear. The first timeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The second time you'd get real angry! ""Now cut that out!"" Actually different people would react differently. Some of us would try to get even. Some of us would get very creative in avoiding, wearing a helmetÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is exactly what we've done in the area of sexuality. Some of us have decided, ""I don't care about it anymore."" We've hardened our hearts in this area. Some of us have completely lost the vision for intimacy of any kind. Some of us have retreated from the opposite sexÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>But I am committed</h3> Whenever I talk about this, someone says to me later, ""But we are committed! I don't want to rip anyone off! We even want to get married!"" Then I say, ""Well, good. Why don't you?"" ""Oh well, the parents, the detailsÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" ""Well, if you're not ready to make the committment in other ways?by putting your name on the line, your reputation on the line, your family on the line?then why are you making the commitment sexually?"" And what answer comes back to me? ""Because we love each other!"" Here's the addage. It's cute but true: Love can wait to give; but lust can't wait to take! The very first quality of love listed in 1ÿCor.ÿ13 is, ""Love is paitent!"" When someone says, ""We need to have sex because I love you!"" Use your brain and recoil from that person. Because that person is not only lustful and selfish like all the rest of us, that person is a manipulative liar. I would have more respect for someone who said, ""I'm horny and I want to have sex because it would make me feel good!"" <h1>Love is not possessive (I Cor. 13:4, 5)</h1> The second principle of love that applies here is that love is not possessive. Paul says it this way in 1ÿCor.ÿ13.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ The term he uses for jealousy means you are possessive of that person, that you cling to that person. Paul says love is not that way. This may also be related to the notion of love not being self-seeking. This refutes the idea that love says, ""I need you! I've got to have you!"" Which are staples of Hollywood love and music love. ""I'm so lost without youÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" There is an insecurity, and therefore a possessiveness that dominates most romantic relationships. Let's think of how it effects these realities of dating. <h2>When it comes to ending a relationship</h2> I think this principle applies especially when it comes to ending a relationship. Insecure, self-centered, possessive people have a doubly-hard time ending a relationship. It's hard for all of us, because of reality number 4?it hurts. But it's extra-traumatic if God hasn't worked on the self-centered insecurity that we all struggle with. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: <h1>Love is boldly self-sacrificing (John 15:12, 13)</h1> What I mean by this is that love is not self-protective?protecting myself from hurt, saying, ""I can't give myself to someone unless I can trust them,"" ""If I know that someone is going to walk out on me or this relationship isn't going to be here a year from now, I can't love her!"" There is no better picture of this than Jesus Christ again. And especially his relationship with his disciples. As he says in Johnÿ15, for years he laid down his life for these men. He says, ""If you could love the way I have loved, you'd be in great shape."" But what you have to realize is that it was one of these men who betrayed him! And Jesus knew it all along! Way back in ch.ÿ6 he says, ""Did I not choose all of you? And yet I know one of you is against me!"" Jesus knew Judas would betray him. Jesus laid down his life for Judas. Jesus washed Judas's feet. Jesus gave to Judas everything he gave to the other guys. Here is the ultimate picture of love. <h2>We want to protect ourselves</h2> Our selfish love says, ""I'm not going to love you unless you give me certain assurances. I'm not going to love you unless you make me feel safe."" This is why in dating relationships you'll have one or both parties calling for more commitment, more assurances, more security. ""How serious are you about this relationship?"" ""How committed are you to me?"" We do these kinds of things often in a game-playing way. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I had this girl challenge me with, ""I'm not sure we should go on with this relationship."" ""Oh yeah? Why?"" ""Because I'm not good enough for you."" I was thinking, ""Why would anyone ever say that to another person?"" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Other people handle this problem by saying, ""I'm going to reject people first. I'll always be the first one to reject. That way I can be safe."" There are also many people who protect themselves by saying, ""Then I'm not going to get involved in dating at all. I don't want the pain. I don't want to have to break up. I just don't want to go through that."" Again, we've got to look at what we're saying. ""I don't want anyone to cause me pain."" Genuine self-giving love says, ""Even if you aren't committed to me, I can give to you!"" ""Even if you are going to hurt me, I can serve you and love you."" <h1>A miraculous love</h1> Obviously the love we've described this week and last week is not normal. Like I said, in just about every area, God's love is the opposite of ours.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05438.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Marriage &amp; Dating - Buck McCallum",

"1 Peter 5: Humility vs. Pride",1995-09-14,," I think this section should begin with verse 5, because we begin dealing with the topic of submission and humility starting in vs. 5.ÿ When he says, ""Likewise,"" he is simply saying ""furthermore"" or ""moreover."" <h2>Younger men</h2> I think the reason Peter singles out younger men here is kind of obvious.ÿ He knows that this is the particular group of people who have a difficult time with the idea of submitting to anyone.ÿ He wants us all to have a mind of humility toward one-another.ÿ But the younger men may have a harder time with this so he gives them an extra nudge. <h2>The humble</h2> But Peter goes on, and he notes that the over-arching attitude which is necessary is ""Humility.""ÿ The idea of the younger men submitting to the older is also subsumed under the broader topic of humility. And this is the matter I would like to look into further before we progress. <h3>False ideas</h3> I think when people concieve of humility we can get some fairly unattractive pictures in our mind. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: When you think of someone humble, you might think of someone like Martin Short, or just some kind of a big sis.ÿ ""Oh, theres a humble person.ÿ Kick him."" There is kind of a sickly passive and excessively self-effacing picture associated with that word.ÿ In fact, I would say that this is a quality which is not respected in our culture at all today.ÿ Something which people have no use for, in whatever guise. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Instead I think the model of self-assertiveness and self-confidence that we worship in our heroes, both men and women, is seen as the greatest characteristic to be had.ÿ I know this is true because the hereos we see on TV and elsewhere, people like this Bruce Willis character, are characterized by not just self-confidence, but a self-conscious arrogance that is hard to take when you meet that kind of person. And these heroes aren't forced on us by some diabolical TV producers.ÿ These are the ones we like.ÿ That's why they sell. Well I think the general distaste for this whole idea of humility comes largely form a misconception about what it is. <h3>Peter explains</h3> Fortunately Peter explains what this whole idea of humility is for us here in this passage. For one, he contrasts it with that pride and arrogance we are so familiar with.ÿ ""God is opposed to the proudÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" And truthfully, it might be OK for Bruce Willis or Don Johnson, but my friends aren't that way.ÿ And that's because nobody really wants to get close to someone like that.ÿ And if I ever get that way, I chase people away.ÿ Nobody likes people who are like that in real life.ÿ We only tolerate them. But he goes on in vs.ÿ6ff. to explain what it is like to humble yourself under God.ÿ ""Humble yourself under the might hand of Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Casting all your anxieties upon him."" You see, he explains what it means to humble yourself before God.ÿ It involves casting your anxieties upon him because he cares for you.ÿ The idea that is being communicated here is that of neediness.ÿ You have genuine fears or anxieties.ÿ You have troubles.ÿ And so, instead of shellaquing them over with a veneer of pride, you acknowledge that you have genuine needs.ÿ You come to God with those anxieties. <h3>An attractive picture</h3> So, humility is simply having the honesty to understand you have need.ÿ And expressing it appropriately.ÿ This can be with God, as vs.ÿ7 suggests.ÿ But it can also be with other people. I don't know if this is such an unattractive picture.ÿ For one thing, I don't think it is weak.ÿ We're not talking about a slobering idiot writhing around, crying out with all this need. We're talking about normal people.ÿ Normal people like you and me.ÿ But humility means to add a degree of inner strength--the strength to be able to be honest and say, ""I have need."" It's like I've always said, there's only one thing weaker than a weakling: someone who can't admit he's a weakling.ÿ There you have someone who is so captivated by their fears of what others will think and what will I look like, they can't muster up the courage to be honest. And this is why I've always had a hard time with the arrogant.ÿ It's also why I have a hard time with myself when I get like that.ÿ It's insincere.ÿ It doesn't reflect the truth.ÿ To go about and try to foist this impression of togetherness on people--the problem is it's just not true. And worst of all, if you succeed in convincing yourself that you're all together, then those needs and weaknesses mount up.ÿ They go unoticed.ÿ They go unchecked.ÿ And they conquer and destroy the faker. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: It's always interesting to watch the arrogant.ÿ If you are close to someone who is this way, and you don't like them, then just watch `em.ÿ Don't mention that they might have a problem.ÿ Don't mention anything.ÿ Just watch them.ÿ Watch them fall.ÿ Because when you indulge arrogance, you can become so confident and inflated, that you forget your weaknesses and you end up getting broadsided some day. I know because I've spent enough time there.ÿ I'll get high on myself for some reason.ÿ I'll slip into the illusion that I'm not a needy person.ÿ ""That's all the other people.""ÿ And I won't reckognize my own weakness until it is about to overcome me. And I say, ""Don't say anything if you don't like them,"" because if you want to watch someone fall real hard, let them be prideful and arrogant.ÿ But if you love someone, find a way to gently remind them of their need for God.ÿ And let me tell you, gently.ÿ You don't have to come barelling in saying, ""You're arrogant again, you're gonna fall!""ÿ There are more effective ways. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: My wife is good for this.ÿ And I have friends who are good for this too.ÿ But she is most consistent.ÿ ""Buck, what's going on?ÿ Where are you struggling these days?""ÿ I'll tend to bat this question off.ÿ But my friends will keep at me.ÿ As I face that type of question on a regular basis I'm forced to recognize my need for God. We can help each other greatly in this way. <h2>Gospel</h2> You know, there is an even more important application of this idea of humility.ÿ Because there is this general maxim Peter gives us in vs.ÿ5, ""God is opposed to the proudÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" I want to give you an appreciation for how powerful and all-encompasing this statement is.ÿ God is looking for an attitude out of people.ÿ And this is it.ÿ You may think, ""Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. of course, he wants me to be good.""ÿ Wrong!ÿ God is looking for an attitude of humility, that is, neediness out of people. And you know what?ÿ He shatters all our conceptions of the way things ought to be. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Look with me at a passage in Luke 18.ÿ Here we have two men going upÿ.ÿ.ÿ.ÿ Now, the first one prays, ""God I thank youÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ Now I know what you're thinking.ÿ You're thinking, ""Of course, a pharisee!ÿ Look at him!ÿ Isn't that how they got their name ""pharisee?""ÿ Isn't that what it means to be a pharisee?!ÿ To be an inflated idiot like this guy?""ÿ And right from the start we know how this story is going to end. But that wasn't Jesus' intention here.ÿ He was trying to lead his audience along.ÿ He was trying to paint a picture of someone very admirable.ÿ Look, ""I thank you, God, that I'm this way or thatÿ.ÿ.ÿ.""ÿ That's not so bad, is it?ÿ And he is genuinely thankful that he is not an adulterer, swindler, or, like this one, a traitor tax-gatherer. Those of you who haven't studied this period of history might not know that tax-gatherers weren't like the IRS manÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So you're sitting here, listening to Jesus tell this story and you're saying, ""Yup, that's good.ÿ That's a good prayer.""ÿ And then this tax-gatherer prays.ÿ And look at him.ÿ Ashamed, alienated from God, and rightly he should be.ÿ He couldn't even lift up his eyes to God.ÿ You're sitting here, listening to Christ, ""Yea, we all know someone like that!"" But he went home justified!ÿ Christ throws in this punch-line at the end that really has some kick.ÿ It was the other guy who went home with God's forgiveness and favor! The only way I can possibly make you feel the lesson Christ is giving here is to think of it in terms of the clergyman and the drug-dealing prostitute.ÿ We're too far from the situation to really feel its impact.ÿ And the clergyman is praying, ""Well God, I guess I'm thankful that I'm not a drunkard, I'm not a mafia boss, and I'm not like this poor prostitute-drug dealer here, Lord."" She, on the other hand, doesn't even have a prayer.ÿ She just has an attitude, ""God, have mercy on me.""ÿ And God recognizes the attitude of the prostitute, not the prayer of the clergyman. Why?ÿ Because the latter expresses <em>need</em>. This is what God is looking for out of people.ÿ And that is why Jesus had his greatest conflicts with the religious of his day.ÿ Religion obscures this one simple fact, ""I have need for God's mercy.""ÿ The whole goal of religion is to make you feel like you're OK, like you're doing something for God. But God simply wants us to recognize our neediness.ÿ I don't know if you have ever come into contact with God on this basis.ÿ But the Bible tells us that you can approach God and express your neediness for his mercy, and you get it.ÿ That's what our passage in IÿPeterÿ5 says, ""God gives grace to the humble.""ÿ God's grace is is love.ÿ That's what the word refers toÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>The Accuser</h1> But let's move on to the next topic as Peter winds down this letter.ÿ He is spilling out some of his final concernsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>His existence</h2> He refers to that strange character, ""the devil.""ÿ I was reading an article recently where a professor was tracing the recent rise in religious ferment on campuses to an increase in movies about the devil, like the Exorcist.ÿ He said it is a short leap from believing in a devil to becoming a Fundamentalist. Of course, in saying this he was insinuating that the narrow, simple views of fundamentalism were one in the same with a belief in the Devil. Well, I hate stereotypes.ÿ And so, someone asks me, ""Are you a fundamentalist?""ÿ No.ÿ ""Do you interpret the Bible literally?"" Well, not exactly.ÿ I try to discover the author's intent.ÿ ""Do you have black and white answers for everything?""ÿ Maybe, Maybe not. ""Do you believe in a Devil?""ÿ Now what am I supposed to say?ÿ Wonder if I do?ÿ Does that make me a raving fundamentalist?ÿ Or is it just possible that people have carefully thought about where they stand and why they believe what they believe, and they still hold that there is such a thing as an evil spiritual force?ÿ Yes. I don't consider the belief in a devil, or whatever you want to call him, any more stupid or incredible than a belief in a God.ÿ How can I?ÿ They're both the same class of being, spiritual.ÿ And experientially there's just as much evidence for a bad spiritual being as a good one.ÿ So, really, this thought, which the Bible affirms, is not such a hard pill to swallow.ÿ And I feel a little put off when belief in such a spiritual being automatically slots you in with some silly stereotype. <h2>An adversary</h2> Well, Peter describes him here as an adversary.ÿ And the word he uses is one they used in the courts, of your opponent in court.ÿ Peter is trying to convey here a picture of the Devil which is pretty common in the Bible--that of an accuser.ÿ He is an adversary in the sense that he brings charges against people.ÿ He brings accusations against people. There is a great ennactment of this idea in the book of Job. ÿHere Satan, the Devil, comes before God and says, ""What do you think of that Job character, you think he's pretty righteous don't you?ÿ Well, let me tell you what I think.ÿ I think he's a patsy.ÿ I think you buy him off with good gifts.ÿ Who wouldn't be faithful with all the stuff you've given him?!"" So the Devil brings charges against Job.ÿ And then he preceeded to persecute him and try to wreck his faith. The Bible records this story because it so perfectly portrays the kind of attitude this character has.ÿ Seething with hatred.ÿ Overflowing with hatred for human beings and especially God's followers. You have to understand, this guy didn't just get raised on the wrong side of the tracks.ÿ He began his career in paradise, the Bible tells us in Ez.ÿ28.ÿ And the reason he left was that he became so arrogant, so puffed up with himself that he was outraged anyone else could be on the throne besides himself. ""How come God is sitting up there like he's God?ÿ I can't stand it.ÿ I'm gonna be God!"" So the Bible tells us he is pretty much bent on destruction all the time.ÿ And he likes nothing more than to find a weak spot in a Christian and exploit it.ÿ This is why he is called the accuser. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember a few years back, in fact quite a few years back now, I was about to give a teaching on the whole matter of suffering.ÿ And someone suggested to me that I was a young pup, wet behind the ears, and knew nothing of the topic I was going to teach on.ÿ Well, I don't want to suggest that the Devil was speaking through that person because it was just an affectionate teasing.ÿ But over the next few days I couldn't forget that idea.ÿ ""Yea, you really don't know anything about suffering, or anything for that matter.""ÿ This became an obsessive thought.ÿ It became an obsession to the point that I could not carry off that teaching and at the last minute had to call someone else in to cover me. Well, I'm convinced that there were spiritual forces involved in that exchange.ÿ Nothing could be more typical of these spiritual beings than to take pleasure in rattling us, making us feel inadequate, or even evil, so we can't carry on with the Lord's work. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I'll recall something you may be very familiar with.ÿ Here you are on the afternoon of a home church, or even heading off to the meeting, and you begin to notice what an idiot your wife is, or your husband.ÿ ""She's completely self-centered in this area or that.""ÿ So you attack.ÿ Or perhaps you're the one who is attacked.ÿ You have to get down to the bottom of the issue now because it is the sinle most life-threatening thing you know of. So by the time you get to hc, you're wiped out.ÿ I'll propose that often this kind of thing comes from a spiritual source.ÿ Here some spiritual being has used you, or suggested something accusatory to you, to wipe the both of you out. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I don't know how long it's been going on now--years.ÿ It's the same thing every week.ÿ Along comes Monday afternoon because I have my home church on Monday night, and I remember all the problems I've got.ÿ I remember just how serious a sinner I really am.ÿ And without fail, I start to get depressed.ÿ I go out to visit my family sometimes on Mon. afternoon and they wonder why I'm so sullen.ÿ It's because I have so many problems! But of course, once home church is over, everything's OK.ÿ Problems?ÿ What problems?ÿ I can hardly even remember what they were, until next Mon. And you can imagine what happens when you get ready to come up here. I don't know if all of you realize this.ÿ But when you become active in serving the Lord, you become an excessively attractive target for these vicious spiritual beings. The next time you start really getting down because of all your problems and all your sins, just ask yourself this, ""What am I about to do that will benefit God's kingdom?ÿ What is about to happen of spiritual consequence?"" I just can't belive how stupid we are sometimes.ÿ I'll be talking to one of my fellow hc leaders and they'll be finally convinced that they shouldn't be a leader or that they can't conquer this problem.ÿ And I'll remind them, ""You know you're supposed to teach tommorow night.""ÿ And that's enough.ÿ It's like the wake up and remember, ""Oh, yea!ÿ Someone might be suggesting these things to me!"" I do it myself.ÿ I told you what happens every time something important is coming up.ÿ But do you think I always remember?ÿ Of course not.ÿ I let myself get caught all the time. And that is exactly what Peter's point is here.ÿ Don't get caught!ÿ There's someone so persistent, so vicious, out there he can only be compared to a roaring lion. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: One thing about lions in those days, you didn't have guns, or anything like that.ÿ If a lion attacked you might be able to get dagger out, or try to club him.ÿ But either way, you'd be in trouble.ÿ So you can bet one thing.ÿ If you even thought you were being stalked by one of these creatures, sobriety and alertness would be the least of your problems.ÿ You wouldn't even have to tell me to be alertÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Well, that is exactly what Peter is saying.ÿ Realize this character is out there and capable of damage. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I've told you some light-hearted stories.ÿ But I want to tell you, I've seen fellow brothers and sisters go down in flames spiritually because they didn't weather an accusatory attack by these spiritual beings.ÿ It's a horrible sight.ÿ If you hang around vital Christians very long, you'll see it too.ÿ You won't have any problem comparing it to a ravaging lion. <h1>Resisting him</h1> I want to put in some time thinking about this idea of resisting him.ÿ Because I've painted a pretty bleak picture.ÿ John gives us some insight into what this means to resist him firm in our faith in the book of Revelations. Here, John is seeing kind of a prophetic drama played out for him regarding the Devil. <h2>The accuserÿ.ÿ.ÿ. thrown down</h2> See first he notes that God's kingdom has come.ÿ And he is refering to the time in the future when God will firmly establish his kingdom.ÿ But he says, ""The one who is always accusing is cast down, overcome."" Then he explains why. <h2>Blood of the Lamb</h2> He says for one, those who overcame the Devil did so because of the blood of the Lamb.ÿ He is refering to the fact that we are accepted by God on the basis of Christ's death on our behalf.ÿ Christ's death, the Bible says, cleanses us of any wrong. Yes I've got problems.ÿ Yes I make mistakes.ÿ Yes, there are serious flaws in my character.ÿ But Christ has covered all that. That's the idea he is trying to communicate here.ÿ We overcome Satan's accusations, not by saying, ""No, that's not true.ÿ There's nothing wrong with me.""ÿ You overcome him by saying, ""So what, God accepts me in spite of that.""ÿ And that resonse, that attitude on the part of the Christian, appealing to God's grace, is just too much.ÿ He has no reply for this. <h2>By their word</h2> Secondly he notes that the Devil is overcome by the word of our testimony.ÿ In other words, the best defense is a good offense. Here I am, frozen in my chair after a home church teaching ora central teaching.ÿ Why?ÿ Because I was stupid again and I've been thinking about myself all day and all my problems.ÿ The accuser go to me. So what do I do?ÿ I get up, go over, and begin encouraging someone about how good God really is.ÿ What he's done in my life.ÿ Or perhaps what he could do in there's.ÿ I start to actually speak forth God's word! What could be worse?!ÿ Again, these spiritual beings have no real weapons when we start to speak God's word to others.ÿ Remember talking about that a couple weeks ago?ÿ How we can get involved in speaking God's word to others? <h2>Did not love their lives</h2> Finally, they didn't love their lives.ÿ John is drawing attention to the selfless Christian.ÿ The one who doesn't even cling to his own life.ÿ What kind of threat do you bring against someone this dedicated? No, the Devil fears this kind of person.ÿ How many of us have given our lives to the Lord to this extreme?ÿ I don't know, but may there be many more. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 26px""><strong> </strong></span>",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05701.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","1 Peter 1995 - Buck McCallum",

"Christian Life: The Resurrection's Significance",1996-03-15,," <h1>The significance of the resurrection</h1> Last week we talked about the evidence for the resurrection. But this week we're talking about it's significance. There are a number of ways we can look at the significance of the resurrection, and we're going to choose a couple of them. For one thing, the cross and resurrection is the ultimate picture of God's triumph. It's an example of how we see the small picture but God sees the big picture. But secondly the resurrection is an evidence of Christ's victory over sin. We're going to talk about both these perspectives tonight, beginning with how it is that we see things so differently from God. <h1>God's view is different from ours</h1> There is a story in Luke 24 that portrays the difference between our view of things and God's view. It's great because it reveals how the death and resurrection of Christ is a perfect picture of this difference. <h2>Luke 24:11,12</h2> Just to set the stage, we see that Mary and Mary came back from the empty tomb to tell the disciples about Jesus' resurrection. And for the most part, the disciples didn't believe them. It says Peter went down to check it out, but he didn't know what to think about it. Then Luke tells this story about two of the disciples and their encounter with the risen Christ. <h2>Luke 24:13-14</h2> It says two of them were going to the village of Emmaus. We know that one of them was named Cleopas. The other is unnamed and may have been Luke himself. At any rate, we learn later in the story that Emmaus was their home. That is where they lived. So these disciples, like many of the other disciples (including Peter) decided to go home. They had followed Christ and put their hope in him, but now he had been killed. So now they're going home. They have been disappointed. They are sad. So now they're going home. <h2>Luke 24:15-16</h2> So Jesus comes up but it specifically states that they were prevented from recognizing them, which is just fascinating. I believe this was an act of God to keep them from recognizing him so that the drama we are about to read could unfold. <h2>v. 17</h2> Jesus asks them, ""What are you talking about?"" And the sadness is overwhelming. Luke says they stopped right there in the road, with their faces down. If they were mildly sad, they would have said, ""Oh, we're just talking about such and such."" <h2>v. 18</h2> You must be a newcomer to these parts! Are you the only one who hasn't heard all the comotion? Jesus innocently asks, ""What things?"" <h2>v. 19-24</h2> Here's the key to the attitude. And the reason it's been included here is it's also our attitude: ""We were hopingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and now it's been three days."" Here's the epitome of our perspective on things. ""We were hoping."" You know how we have these expectations of God. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was hoping that God would take care of this problem for meÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And now it's clear he hasn't met the deadline. We think we know what is good. Jesus was mighty. We know what he should have done. He should have freed Israel. He should have established himself in power. But instead, these mere humans took him and killed him. Now, it's been three days, and we're going home. The cross was indeed the greatest victory you could imagine. God freed the human race from the debt of sin. God freed us from the debt of judgment. God made it possible for humans to have a relationship with him and eternal life. But these guys thought they had a better plan. And this is the way it is in area after area. We think we know what's best. We think we know how God should do his job. And when he doesn't do it our way or meet our deadlines, then we hang our heads and say, ""I can't believe he's let me down. Why has God let me down!"" <h2>v. 25-27</h2> Now Jesus' answer is kind of funny. ""How foolish you are!"" What kind of thing is that for a stranger to say? Why were they foolish? Jesus goes on to say, ""You're slow of heart to believe all the scriptures sayÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" There you have it. They didn't want to believe <em>all</em> the scriptures say. Sure, they knew about the victorious Messiah. They knew about the promise of the kingdom. They knew about all the good things promised in the Bible. But they didn't want to believe the other stuff. Then Jesus goes on to explain what it was they didn't want to believe, ""Didn't the Christ have to suffer?"" Then he went on to reveal the scriptures to them. <h2>There are many scriptures on the suffering Christ</h2> Of course there are many scriptures on the suffering of the Messiah. Right from the beginning. As it says here, he started with Moses, which means Genesis. In Gen. 3ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. In Gen. 22 one of the most remarkable predictionsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Then the prophets are full of the suffering Messiah imagery (Isa. 53) <h2>Christ had told themÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h2> Beyond that, Christ had told them he would be killed. And I've always been amazed at their reaction. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Mark 9:9-10 And there are a number of other places where Jesus told them plainly what was going to happen to him, but they were always puzzled by it. So I've wondered, how can a guy say, ""Listen, we're going down to Jerusalem. I'll be killed there, and then I'll raise from the dead three days later."" And then you say, ""I wonder what he means by that?"" That seemed ridiculous. Until I realized this exactly what we do all the time. The Bible promises great things for us as Christians: victory over our problems; love; peace; joy; impact and success. And it also promises that the way to those things is the same way Christ took?through suffering, through hardship, through failures, through rejection. Let's look at Luke 9:22-24ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. There it is. Jesus promises that in a way, you and I are going to go through the same thing. God has in mind for each of us incredible victory, success, change, impact, joyÿ.ÿ.ÿ. And yet the way he's going to bring that about may not be the way we have in mind. Jesus is obviously using the notion of the cross as a metaphor here, because he says to pick it up daily. But the idea is we are willing to undergo suffering. We are willing to undergo the death of our pride, or our selfishness, in order to experience new life?a resurrection from the dead. And yet, how many people have we seen, or how many times have we been tempted to say, ""I had hoped it would be different than this. I'm going home."" God's ways are different than ours. And he makes no secret of it. But Jesus says we are foolish to not believe <em>all</em> that the scriptures say. <h1>New life from the resurrection</h1> This leads us directly to the second application of the resurrection, and that is the new life we are promised as a result of the resurrection. <h2>Romans 6:4-8</h2> Here's the promise: Jesus' death pays for our sins. He speaks of it in terms of us being united with him in his death. It's as if I died. My sins have been paid for. It's as if I was on that cross because Jesus died in my place. So Paul says, ""Just as sure as your old self was crucified and paid for on the cross, you have the offer of a completely new life."" He uses phrases here like, ""we will life a new life,"" and, ""we will be freed from sin.""ÿ These are remarkable promises! Anyone who has ever struggled with a habbit you just hate can relate to how great these promises are. Or haven't you seen something about yourself that you wish you could change?something so deep down it affects every relationship you haveÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I was being confronted by this guy last week on my isolation from people, the way I wall myself off from people. And I have struggled with this problem for years. On the one hand, I want to wall myself off from people because it's great protection. On the other hand, it leads to loneliness. And it leads to ineffectiveness in my love for others. I read this and I say, ""I want a new life. I want to be done with this problem."" And that is the promise of God. I want that freedom. I want victory over that problem. But, I have to be careful to believe all that the Scriptures say. And when we read all the scriptures, we see other passages like one we read a couple weeks ago in Gal. 5:17ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Now here I see that the transition to the new life is not automatic. It involves struggle. Paul portrays it in terms of a conflict. Surely it is going to happen?as sure as Christ raised from the dead. And believe me, there is no way to change our innermost characteristics other than to have God change them. Sure, anyone can change a habbit. Anyone can modify this or that behavior. But we can't change the selfishness. We can't change the prideful spirit that gives rise to all those other things. It's going to have to be a miracle of God. But here Paul tells us that change will come in the face of conflict. And Jesus tells us it will come because we take up our cross. In other words, we will go through some hard times before we begin to see the new life God promised. That's what all the scriptures say. <h2>Why is this?</h2> Let's just conclude with some thoughts about why this is. Why is it that God says ""death first, then life""? ""Death first, then victory?"" It's the same reason that Jesus had to suffer and die first, then resurrection and victory: and that is the seriousness of sin. Why did Jesus have to go through all this suffering and dying busines? Because our sin is so serious it warrants judgment. It may be hard for you and me to believe that. And that's precisely the reason some people will not turn to God for forgiveness. They don't think their sin warrants Jesus' death. But when God exposes us for what we really are, there will be no doubt about the need for Jesus' death. It's the same way with us, even though we've been forgiven. God offers to change us and give us new life. But we first have to see that we need it. So God has to take us through a death processÿ.ÿ.ÿ.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05745.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",

"Christian Life: Anxiety and Worry",1996-05-03,,"  <h1>ÿPhilippians 4</h1> <h1>Intro</h1> We've been going over the book of Philippians for the last month or so. Tonight we're on the last chapter, and it's a chapter that deals with something a lot of us suffer from?worry or anxiety. But before we get into it, I'm going to say something that might surprise some of you who know your Bibles here tonight: If you're not anxious, then you have an evil and self-centered heart. If you don't worry, then you have an evil and self-centered heart. Having said that, we can look at our passage tonightÿ.ÿ.ÿ. You can see from v. 6 that we're not supposed to be anxious, according to this verse. ""Thou shalt not be anxious,"" is basically what it's saying here. But what might surprise you is that Paul uses the same word to describe Timothy earlier in ch.ÿ2:20ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So here ""concern"" or it may be better to translate, ""intense concern,"" is a quality. What we need to do is explore the differences between the types of worry that are bad and the type that is good. <h1>Healthy concern</h1> I want to look first at the type of concern or anxiety that is good. Because it's going to teach us a lot by contrast. To look back at the Phil. 2 passage, you will see that this concern is directed towards others. In fact, Paul states that this type of concern ought to be the norm in the church, if you'll look at 1ÿCor.ÿ12:25ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Here is the ideal in the church, we should be concerned and burdened for one another. Paul takes this idea and elaborates on it in 2ÿCor.ÿ11:28-29ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. See the imagery here of ""intense concern"" and being burndened by it. And it's a hardship. He lists it right along with being beaten and tortured, thrown in jailÿ.ÿ.ÿ. I bring this up because so many people want freedom from the bad feelings or pressures that anxiety can bring. We want a carefree, good-feelings existence. And that desire is as self-centered and wrong as the self-obsessed type of anxiety mentioned in Phil.ÿ4:6. The fact is, experiencing pressure and intense concern over others is good. It is God's will for us. Now, let's go back to Phil. 4 and consider what it is saying about harmful anxiety. <h1>Present your requestsÿ.ÿ.ÿ.</h1> Again we see the command to not be anxious. And the key is what he says to do about it. We're to ""present our requests to God."" There's a certain type of anxiety that God wants to free you from. And that's anxiety that relates to your concerns, your requests, your needs. Those are the ones that God wants to take care of. And he wants other people to take care of them. And he wants you to take care of other people's. Here is where I want to understand why God addresses the issue of anxiety so much. Anxiety is destructive, not because it gives us ulcers, psoriasis, hair loss or sleep loss. Anxiety is destructive because it represents an intense self-centerdness that destroys love in our lives. God created us for love. When our life is full of selfishness, then of course there are many side-effects. But the core problem is that we are self-centered, self-absorbed people. You see this in passage after passage where the Bible addresses anxiety. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: For example, there's the famous passage in Matt. 6 where Jesus says, ""Do not be anxiousÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" But if follows on the heals of ""Therefore."" Therefore what? The preceeding context is about not laying up treasure for yourself. Anxiety is about self-centerdness. It's where we pour energies and thoughts and fantasies into how we can take care of ourselves. The irony here is if you look at all the ""cure"" for worry, they all have to do with further self-centeredness. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: take more time for yourself. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: learn how to tune people outÿ.ÿ.ÿ. The truth is, most of these cures just create a greater self-focus and worries of a different kind. Now I""m worried about being worried. Not I'm worried about ordering my world and controling my world. The great mystery of God's ways, the lifestyle of love God has for us, is to understand that you are not responsible for yourself. Instead, God is responsible for you. And he wants you to take responsibility for others. We'll talk about that notion in a bit. But first let's understand how anxiety chokes out love. <h2>Things we're anxious about</h2> <h3>Finances, etc.</h3> I worry about these at times, especially in relation to my business. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: The way it works is that when I'm anxious, I'll sit down to pray and immediately into my mind springs a thousand items; to-do lists, things I""ve forgotten, plans, calculations, etc. So I might be sitting there trying to pray, about one of you, ""God, help ? withÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h3>What others think of me</h3> Some people care little about deadlines or finances, but they're obsessed with what others think of them, how they appear. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: So you can be talking to someone and get the distinct impression that they're nervous. And as a result they're not real. They're stilted and fakey. And you know how it is if you've suffered from this. You're so concerned about yourself?so worried about yourself?that you can't even bring yourself to have a real conversation with someone and you wind up looking like a fool (just like you feared). It's frustrating. <h3>Dangers</h3> It's the same thing with fears and anxieties about dangers. Love is risky. Jesus got himself killed because he loved. Helping people often means doing things where you can fail or be embarassed or do something threatening to your security. So our anxieties prevent us from having a bold, aggressive love. <h2>Sum up</h2> So, the bad kind of anxiety stifles love in our lives. The bad kind of anxiety comes when we let our self-centerdness run rampant, unchecked in our thought life and emotions. And as a result it strangles our love. <h1>God's ways</h1> Now let's talk about God's ways, experiencing freedom from this self-centered anxiety. <h2>God wants to take care of me</h2> The first solution is to realize that God is the one who wants to take care of me. In other words, I am not responsible for myself. God wants to take responsibility for me. That is why Paul says to present all your requests to God. It's not because it will be good to voice them to someone. It's because he's actually responsible. Prayer is acknowleding it, thankfully. Matt. 6:30-33 What does it mean when it says, ""These things will be given to you?"" You know what I think it means? I think it means these things will be given to you. Which really stretches the imagination. How can these things be ""given to me?"" Don't you have to work? Don't you have to be responsible? Here's the answer: My responsibility is not to take care of myself and meet my needs. My responsibility is to be obedient to God. And part of what God commands is that we labor so we have enough to meet our needs and the needs of others as well. But if, in my obedience to God, I've run out of money or resources, he'll get them to me. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember a situation in Chicago where I was in a bind because I had thousands of dollars in capital tied up with a job that wasn't going to be finished till spring. All we wanted to be able to do was come home for Christmas. But we were realizing we couldn'tÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Part of obedience to God is to work and meet your physical needs that way. But if in the course of following him you're not making ends meet, you would be amazed how many other resources God has. <h2>Worry about others</h2> Secondly, part of the answer to self-centered worry is to actually excercise the right kind of anxiety/concern/worry: concern for others. My job is not to worry about me, but it is my job to worry about you. Now of course, there is the danger of becoming overly-responsible. Because each person is ultimately in the hands of God. But part of God's provision for others is you. His ideal is to create a community where people worry about each other (or you can use the word ""concern"" if you want). see 1 Cor. 12:25 But you should try this some time. It's really fascinating. Try worrying about someone else. Like I mentioned before, it can be real exposing. You sit down to think about someone else and all it does is remind you of your own needsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But there is a tremendous freedom that comes when you get to a point where most of your worries are about other people. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I remember I kept a diaryÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>The ""peace of God""</h1>",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t05810.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",

"Christian Life: Anxiety",1996-10-24,,"  <h1>What is already thought-out and planned in our lives?</h1> Exercise: Write out a list of our worries re. the next day, week and year. (Draw out the fact that they all seem reasonable) Matt. 6:25&amp;34 Here is a tension: On the one hand we are supposed to be responsible, we have to plan, it seems like we have to worry. If we don?t worry, who will? On the other hand, Jesus says, ?Don?t worry about anything regarding the future.? We?ll talk about this tension tonight. <h1>My own anxieties</h1> First I thought I would share my own tendencies in this area. I have this tendency to think about one thing all the time, over and over again. Even if I can?t find a solution, I keep thinking about it. <strong><em>Example:</em></strong> ÿI?ve been having problems at work, I shared with some of you, where we may loose one of our main clients. We?re working on a proposal to save the situation, and it may work out. I still don?t know. But I?ve been thinking and worrying about this constantly for about a month now. What will we do if we loose them? How can we keep them? What if this happens? What if that happens? And it seems to me like I have to do this. This worry is necessary. When I read a passage like this, I think to myself, ?This has to be an exaggeration.? It can?t be that he actually means ?don?t worry about tomorrow.? That?s not possible and seems like it would actually be stupid. <h1>The text: it?s about money (v. 19ff.)</h1> Let?s look deeper into what Jesus is saying here. (read whole text) What is this text about? It?s about money. So it concerns my problem perfectly. Maybe what we could do here is look at the individual parts and understand them, then look at the big picture. <h2>19-21: Where your treasure is</h2> ?Treasure on earth? we understand. We would all like to store up a little of that, right? Why not? But what is ?treasure in heaven?? What?s going to be in heaven? What he?s saying is that we should invest our time, our money, our resources in people. <h2>v. 33: Seek first the kingdom. . .</h2> This is where he explains how to store up treasure in heaven. What does it mean to seek first the kingdom? Matt. 22:34-40 This is the law of thekingdomofGod. We are supposed to seek these things. And what does he promise will happen if we do? This is a guarantee from God that if we seek first these things, he?ll take care of the other things. <h2>Exaggeration?</h2> Again, I return to this question: Is this an exaggeration? Is this possible? From one side, this seems like insanity. It seems like stupidity. Honestly speaking, when I read this, I want to take it as an exaggeration. You know when a person speaks, and this is a speech, they tend to exaggerate for impact. But then I look at a passage like Phil. 4:6 . . . Here is a passage that?s not a speech. He?s writing instructions to the church atPhilippi. And he says the exact same thing. <h1>A relationship with God</h1> There is an assumption here that serves as a foundation. And that assumption is just as hard to believe. What is it? It?s in both these passages. God cares about you. That?s easy to say. But let?s think about what it means. . . It means that there is a relationship here that is so detailed, he knows me so intimately, and he?s involved in the smallest details of my life. When we talk about ?believers? versus ?non-believers?, we?re talking about this right here. We?re talking about people who have this type of relationship with God. And before we have such a relationship with him, we have to remove the barrier that exists?the barrier of sin. A person has to turn to God and ask for this relationship, and ask for the forgiveness that makes such a relationship possible. This is the word ?repentance.? But for me, as a believer, this is still very hard to believe. . . Let?s look back at Matt. 6. . . <h1>Mammon?</h1> Who knows what Mammon is? This was a god of that time, the god of money. What does money give us? It gives us security, opportunities, . . . These are all things that God wants to give us. Why does he say you can?t serve two masters? It would be like getting married but keeping the lover on the side, ?Just in case you don?t make me happy.? God says this doesn?t work, it?s just not possible. You?re heart will go one way or the other. He also knows this: that if there?s a contest between him and money, he?ll usually lose. Money is so attractive and powerful, a man will do almost anything for it. . . And of course we know it?s not the money itself, it?s the things that money can get you. And those are the things that God want to give. &nbsp;",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t06035.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",
"Christian Life: God's Will - Writing in the Sky?",1996-11-01,,"  <h1>The dilemma</h1> We're talking about the issue of God's will tonight and for the next few weeks. And when I use the term ""God's will"" I'm refering to the notion that a personal God has a plan for your life. And that's a premise in itself that presents lots of problems. <h2>That God's will is good</h2> Last week we talked about the goodness of God. And we discussed the fact that God's goodness is something we really don't believe. That's the bone of contention between ourselves and him. <h2>That the infinite God could care</h2> It's also difficult to imagine that God's plan for my life could be anything more than the most general direction, ""You ought to love your neighbor as yourself."" In other words, it's hard to imagine a God who is involved in the details of my individual life."" <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: ""It is the height of arrogance to presume the infinite God is listening to me, but it's a good idea to pray nonetheless."" And it is. It's hard to believe that God hears my prayers, much less has any kind of good intention in mind for me. <h2>That he makes his will known</h2> Then even if I believe that he's personal, loving and has good intentions for me, there's still the problem of ever hearing from him. Would he make his will known or not? Even those of us who have been Christians for a long time are often frustrated by what appears to be the silence of God. We'll get frustrated especially in difficult situationsÿ.ÿ.ÿ. ""Why doesn't he show me what to do!?"" <h2>What will happen to me if I fail to follow ""The Plan""?</h2> If he has one, and he's trying to communicate, what happens if I miss part of it, don't hear him or just outright disobey him? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Here's the plan: collegeÿ.ÿ.ÿ. marriage to Sueÿ.ÿ.ÿ. a kid named Willieÿ.ÿ.ÿ. and I miss the marriage to Sue part. Now I can't have a kid named Willieÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h1>God sees these problems</h1> You might be interested to know that God also sees these problems. In fact, from his point of view, these are the major problems that we face as people. God describes us in terms like, ""sheep without a shepherd,"" and ""those who have lost their way without guidance."" It's a situation, according to the Bible, that is deeply burdening to God. In fact Jesus went to great lengths to explain that God is very different than we might think. He is intimate and personal, aware of our every needÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (infinite vs. personal, talk about how that works). Luke 12:5-7; John 10:14-15; Lord's prayer (guidance is premise) <h2>He says his guidance is there</h2> So God's position is that his guidance is there. As I said, when Jesus teaches us how to pray it's entirely founded on the notion of receiving God's guidance. What's more Galatians 5 speaks of being led by the Spirit of God?that God's Spirit somehow leads us. What I want to do tonight is look at two stories. One of a person who did not want God's guidance, and the other of someone who did. <h1>Ahab: Don't bother me</h1> The first is the picture of King Ahab. He was somewhat of a bad guy in the Bible's reckoning. But there is an instance in 2 Kings 18 that really highlights the problem. read 1-23, tell rest of story <h2>Where's the voice of the Lord?</h2> Here you have a situation where there are literally hundreds of voices, not unlike our own situation. But the king of Judah says, ""Where is the voice of the Lord in all this?"" Somehow he knows that none of these guys represent the voice of the Lord. You can be sure it's not that they weren't pretending to be the voice of God. As you notice later, Cheenah slaps Micaiahÿ.ÿ.ÿ. But there's something about these voices that King Jehoshaphat senses is not from God. And the passage doesn't say what it is. But I think I know what Jehoshaphat was feeling because I've felt it. I've listened to the supposedly Christian voices, the non-Christian voices, the wise guys and know-it-alls, the advice gurus and help-yourselfers. And there is such an air of insincerity, of self-promotion, of great mystical secrets. When we get to heaven and see all the ways God has been communicating, we are going to applaud the genuineness, the understatement and the dignity of God's communication with us. He communicates in a way that has such an air of truth and sincerityÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: I can pull an example from the realm of marketing because that's the world I'm in. Let's think about the difference between Odd Lots and Heiniken Beer. With Odd Lots, the parameters we're given are: Create and add that says in the most obvious way you possibly can, ""Sale! Cheap! Come today!"" With Heiniken, the parameters are: Say quality without saying quality (because all the cheap guys that's the first thing they say, ""Quality Keystone Beer!""); say good times without saying good timesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So they directly position themselves as the antitype of gimmicky, cheap, run-of-the-mill beer. And then there's God. Whos is far more sophisticatedÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: You get a flavor for God's genuineness, the reality of God's involvement in the book of Esther. The name of God or his guidance is not mentioned once. But it's so obvious nobody has to say it. This is one of the questions we need to ask when we're saying, ""Is this the voice of God?"" The question is, ""Is it trite, desparate, cheesy and excessively self-promoting?"" Is there that sense of falseness? <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Let's just think of some of the Oval preachers from this standpoint. You get the sense of desparation. ""If you don't listen to me, I'll yell at you and call you names. I'll do something stupidÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" <h2>How did Ahab know?</h2> OK, so Jehoshaphat knew that none of these guys was the voice of the Lord. At the same time, Ahab knew that what Micaiah said the first time wasn't the voice of the Lord. How did he know that? He knew because it wasn't negative. As Ahab said, ""This guy always says negative things about me."" Here is real insight into someone who doesn't want God's guidance. This person suspects that what God has to say is negative. We talked about this last week, the suspicion on our part that God is not good and he doesn't have good gifts for us. But here we see that it becomes a real barrier to perceiving the will of God. We know that Ahab didn't really believe that this was God's word. How do we know that? Because he went up. If he really thought God had saidÿ.ÿ.ÿ. So we see that someone who doesn't want the guidance of God perceives God's guidance as negative. The truth is, this guidance wasn't negative. It was a loving warningÿ.ÿ.ÿ. It was just not what Ahab wanted to hear. It was different. <h2>God will provide an alternative</h2> The final, chilling lesson I get from this is that if we don't want to hear God's will, God himself will provide a credible alternative. If there is no alternative, God will see to it that one is provided, as he did in this case. We see this throughout the Bible: God allows there to be a credible alternative to his voice and his will. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: The best example I can think of is when he allowed the first humans to be tempted by Satan himself?the master deceiver! Why would he do this? Because he wants us to follow him because we want to?not because we have to. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: Do I want my wife to marry me because there were no other men available? That's the dilemma God's in. He's the only one. So, how to have it so people don't follow him if they don't want to? <h1></h1>",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t06036.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",
"Christian Life: Fleecing God",1996-11-08,,"  <h1>Intro</h1> We?re doing a series here on God?s will. And last week we talked about how hard it is to believe there us such a thing as God?s will for me. There are a lot of problems with that whole idea: that God lovesÿ.ÿ.ÿ. that he?s interested in little meÿ.ÿ.ÿ. that he could communicate a planÿ.ÿ.ÿ. All these issues are very concerning when it comes to the topic of God?s will. Last week we saw that they are also concerning to God. God is burdened to see us know his will, his good gifts, the great things he has in mind for us (see vv?) The problem is that sometimes we want to hear his will and sometimes we don?t. Last week we looked at someone who didn?t. And we found out some interesting things. <h2>We look to all the other imposters</h2> Ahab last week had collected hundreds of prophets, but not one of them spoke for Godÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <h2>We assume negative</h2> We found out that when you don?t want to hear God?s voice, it?s because we assume it?s going to be negative. <h2>God provides an alternative</h2> Amazingly, we found that when we don?t want to listen to God, he provides a credible alternative. <h2>We try to skirt around</h2> Finally, Ahab went sneaking off to try and skirt around God?s willÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Tonight we want to talk about what we see when someone wants to follow God. How does God deal with someone who does want to do his will? <h1>Gideon</h1> The story of Gideon comes up in covering the will of God because he is the only one in the Bible to have ""fleeced the Lord."" ÿYou?ll see what fleecing the Lord means by the time we?re finished with the story. <h2>Ch. 6</h2> You can see from this story what fleecing is all about. And this is something all of us have wanted to do or have done before. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: OK, God, if you want me to date this girl, then she?ll come up to me tonight. Has anyone ever done anything like this? Do you know what I?m talking about? What?s the difference between what Gideon is doing versus what we do? The issue is that he already knew God?s will. He wasn?t trying to find out what it was. He knew. His fleecing was about getting confidence to follow God?s will. <h2>God wants to help you with confidence</h2> So maybe the first lesson we can draw from this is that God wants to help us with our boldness and confidence to follow him. If we know God?s will, and yet we?re afraid to follow it, God does often give us assurance. Example: I remember trying to decide whether my family and I should go over seas to try and do some church planting, so many people came up and said, ?I heard you?re thinking about thisÿ.ÿ.ÿ.? But at the same time there have been other times when God hasn?t provided that kind of assurance because he wants me to act on what I know is true. <h2>It is legitimate to test the messenger of the Lord</h2> Along those same lines, it is legitimate to test the messenger of the Lord. This is unique to Christianityÿ.ÿ.ÿ. If you are investigating Christianity then you should be saying, ""How do I know? Why do you say that? Where's the evidence?"" And if the answers are not satisfactory then you shouldn't listen. Example: And when someone says, ?I think this is God?s will for your life? (which is a wieghty thing to say), then it is legitimate to say, ?How do you know?? And their advice is only as good as their reasons. <h2>Gideon was going to follow</h2> But there is a big reason why Gideon was able to ask these things from God. It was that he was going to follow God. He was going to take on the Midianites. How do we know that Gideon wanted the will of God? Because he pulled down the shrineÿ.ÿ.ÿ. This is a principle of following God?s will that we often see. God will give us an opportunity to obey him in increments. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People want the right mate. But the question I would ask is, ?How do you handle your relationships with the opposite sex now?? If our relating with the opposite sex now is completely selfishÿ.ÿ.ÿ. Here was a friend of mine who was really angry at God for not giving him the right woman. But the problem was, he wouldn?t talk to women. He avoided them. He was too afraid to have a relationship with the women around him that was servingÿ.ÿ.ÿ. <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline"">Example</span></em>: People wonder, ?What?s God?s will for me in my life?s work? What kind of impact will I make on people and for God in this life?? Well, God will reveal that to you and it will be big, if you take on the seamingly little things right in front of you. There?s a guy in Acts named Barnabasÿ.ÿ.ÿ. God is giving you opportunities to follow his will now that will have a bearing on your life later. <h2>Be ready to act</h2> This willingness to act has a bearing on whether God will even reveal his will to you. The fact is, we know how God deals with people who don't want to hear his wordÿ.ÿ.ÿ. (last week) So many people, like Ahab, just want to hear what God says to confirm their suspicion, ?See, I knew he would disagree with me.? <h2>Ch. 7: He shed light in pieces</h2> God didn't say, ""I'm going to give you only 300 men to defeat this invading armyÿ.ÿ.ÿ."" God's will was revealed bit by bit. That's why in the NT it's called being ""led by the Spirit of God,"" or ""walking with the Spirit of God."" It's the imagery of a step-by-step. There are a lot of reasons for that we'll get into next week.",http://repo.neofreedom.org/public/buck/t06037.mp3,,"Teacher>Buck McCallum","Christian Life",
