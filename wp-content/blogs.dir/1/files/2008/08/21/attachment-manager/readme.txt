This will allow you to better manage how your attachments are handled.  Attachments can be easily listed after posts, complete with icons.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to list attached files on posts.  It comes with a default
icon set (by famfamfam), with icons for most major files types.  You can add
your own icons, as well as control many aspects of the file list (whether you
want to show icons, whether to add the lists to exerpts, place them on all posts,
show them on category pages, etc).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole `attachment-manager` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. You can optionally configure the options through the `options` `Attachment Manager Options` menu
1. You can also optionally chmod the `/wp-content/plugins/attachment-manager/icons` directory to allow you to add/remove icons via the options page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I list only certain attachments? =

You have two options; list all attachments or list attachments that are not already linked in the post.

= Can I add new icons? =

Absolutely, you can manually upload them to wp-content/plugins/attachment-manager/icons or if you chmod that folder, you can upload them via the plugin's options page.
