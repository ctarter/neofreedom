<content:encoded><![CDATA["Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit..." (Matthew 28:18). Christ's Great Commission includes the call to baptize believers, so NeoXenos gathered on September 7<sup>th</sup> at the Walton Hills Lake Club to witness ten people get dunked for Jesus. The event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual symbol of baptism, the real excitement began. Each "baptizee" shared his or her testimony and then was baptized by one or two people who played a role in their decision to follow Christ.

Lisa Kostyak grew up in church but never understood the personal decision needed to know Christ. After coming to Bible studies for over a year, she attended the 2007 baptisms where the testimonies moved her to accept Jesus right away. She said asking for God's forgiveness was "the easiest thing I've done in my life" and explained the overwhelming weight of guilt that was lifted afterward.

Elli Morscher grew up in a Christian home in Xenos, but never knew why she went to Bible studies. Jesus certainly wasn't in her life, as she was a bossy, selfish liar. But 6<sup>th</sup> grade Blowout camp caused her to consider handing her life over to God. She was anxious, but decided to ask God into her heart, and now God is teaching her how to love and giving her "something to live for."
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Lauren Dakters was depressed, anti-social, and self-destructive before she knew Christ. Then she was invited to a high school Bible study and learned about God's forgiveness, which she decided to ask for some time later. She said now "there's more to life than playing emo songs on guitar," and she is a happier and more loving person.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Danielle Fazzio grew up Catholic, but she wasn't interested in God. Her friendships never lasted and she ended up in an abusive relationship. When her friend invited her to a college Bible study, she made fun of her, but eventually she gave it a try. There she admired the relationships and love in the Body of Christ, which caused her to consider the gospel's claims. Since she became a believer, Christ has helped her to impact her friends in new ways.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Mike Hudock was a lonely gamer when friends started inviting him to the high school Bible study. Despite his refusals, he was surprised they didn't give up. When he finally started coming, one of the leaders didn't give up on witnessing to him, either. Finally Ephesians 2:8, 9 convinced him that couldn't earn his way into heaven. He prayed to receive Christ and since then he gained confidence, became less selfish, and wants to tell people about grace.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Paul Song was raised in a Christian family but he viewed God academically. He was lonely, unemotional, and trying to earn his way to heaven by good works. For a long time he avoided the questions raised at the high school Bible study, but was surprised people still accepted him. Four years later a friend explained the story of Nicodemus in John 3 and he realized it was his pride, not a lack of information, which prevented him from accepting salvation. This occurred just one day before the baptisms!</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Tom Smith didn't know how to interact with people besides using them. He thought needing forgiveness was pathetic, but Christians' persistent love for him changed his mind over a period of five years. One man challenged him to ask for salvation and finally his tough shell started to soften. Now he can't imagine where he'd be if he hadn't accepted God's forgiveness.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Shelby Roszkowski was the "cliché" girl in middle school, interested in superficial appearances, gossip, and boys. But as the void in her life began to gnaw, she turned to drugs, dating, using people, and a suicide attempt to numb the pain. Her church background reminded her that Jesus died on the cross to pay for sin. So one day she read Isaiah 40:6, a verse about crying out to God. And she did just that, asking Him to forgive her. She realizes God filled a void she could never fill by herself.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Jordan Yoerger grew up in Xenos with Christian parents, but never really believed what he learned about God. He was a jerk and fought with his parents and brother every day. He also argued relentlessly with one of the high school Bible study leaders, who nevertheless told him, "I will never give up on you." This melted his hard exterior and that night he prayed for God to come into his life. His new faith has motivated him spiritually in a whole new way.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Ephesians 2:8, 9 sounded as a refrain throughout many of the testimonies: "It is by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast." How freeing God's gift is when we realize our sin has been paid for in full! Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Family and friends in the audience heard the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. Two people made the decision to receive Christ during conversations after the baptisms. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.

Be sure to check out <a class="wiki" href="http://neonets.org/blog/joesnake/2007/09/17/baptismal/" target="_blank">Joe's Blog</a> about these baptisms...

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9853&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" />
Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111023410377579746"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Atl5C3OI/AAAAAAAABC0/v77f3ZI5on0/s400/DSC_1085.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9888&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9898&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9901&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9908&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9922&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7QxToZGBI/AAAAAAAAC0s/sHCQmFLi090/HPIM1383.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7Q8ToZGPI/AAAAAAAAC2g/r7s1FHkxzRQ/HPIM1397.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111024411104960594"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Bn15C4FI/AAAAAAAABKM/Pi-fMgEedRg/s288/DSC_1202.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignright" width="215" caption="a wild &amp; wooly ride, but very much worthwhile!"]<img style="border: 0pt none" src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/growth.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="215" height="147" />[/caption]

"It was the best of times, <em>period!</em>" So should begin any recap of 2007 for <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org">NeoXenos</a> (with apologies to Charles Dickens).

Why so upbeat? The past year triggered significant growth in all our ministry groups, despite considerable hurdles. More intriguing is what to expect from new frontiers opened in 2007, such as the Service Ministry, Missions, Discovery Groups, and classes for ministry-equipping. Even more frontiers will open up this year--including another college ministry with a new Akron-based ministry house--which could make 2008 yet another record-breaking year.

With all this growth in new and existing ministries, 2007 was a remarkable break from past years which often stretched scarce leadership resources to the limit. But an unexpected number of new ministers emerged to share the burden and make expansion possible. Veteran leaders were greatly relieved.

All this and more were part of a long weekend of revelations discovered at the 2008 annual SLUM retreat.

The Sphere Leaders' Undershepherd Ministry (SLUM) gathered at Punderson State Park last weekend to prepare for the upcoming Fiscal Support Team (FST) retreat. The SLUM consists of the elders, trustees and their spouses charged with oversight of Xenos finances and activities. Currently the Board of Trustees consists of Joel Hughes, Keith McCallum<a class="wiki wikinew" title="McCallum" href="tiki-editpage.php?page=McCallum">?</a>, Mark Michalek and Greg Morscher, bringing together representatives from all ministry spheres.

Keith opened with observations about the significant change underway in the fellowship. Since Xenos was first planted in this area, 2007 was unique as the first time a large pool of competent and unified leaders emerged, enabling ministry efforts never before possible. A welcome side-effect was the prevalence of loving relationships in all the ministry groups, he said, "which means we're in a position of strength Paul described in Philippians 2."

The passage reads, "If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves." (Philippians 2:1-3 NIV)

This "one in spirit" is remarkable, but Xenos still faces a glaring hurdle, Keith said. Citing John Wesley's efforts in the 1700s, the glaring difference with modern Christianity is the large numbers of "Itinerants," as they were known. These were the people whose courage and Christian evangelism changed England and led the world in bringing God's mercy and love to the common masses. They transformed inhumane "Work House" prisons, built the first humane orphanages and public hospitals for the poor and sick. They abolished the cruel slave trade, and as they spread into America they led the "Radical Abolitionists" who eventually killed slavery here.

They were called the <em>Methodists</em> because they were highly methodical in the way they grew. Xenos imitates their key strategies by meeting in Cell Groups, Home Churches and Central Teachings. These groups seem usual today, but not in Wesley's lifetime. As a result, when Wesley died more than 100,000 Methodists sprawled across England and another 50,000 were penetrating America. All this rested on the backs of the <em>Itinerants</em> who led the movement.

The expanding frontiers in this fellowship not only requires a significant leadership population, but leaders with spiritual stature like the <em>Itinerants.</em> This research and the biblical issues it raises will be presented in more detail at the FST retreat.

The abundance of fruitfulness and God's activity surveyed at the SLUM retreat left the participants exhilarated but thoroughly exhausted. Stay tuned to the Neo News front page as more details emerge.]]></content:encoded>

For those engaged in discipleship or parenting, the new collection of articles about "Millennials" and the "Generation X" phenomena may prove helpful. The series highlights the target of Christian maturity in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, but then digs into the modern social phenomenon hindering maturity (in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/raising-infantiles/" target="_blank">Raising Infantiles</a>). A biblical framework for Christian parenting is then established in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/reality-parenting/" target="_blank">Reality Parenting</a>. All these principles apply to discipleship.

We now have new material available from Katey Downs and the <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics class</a> thanks to Darlene McCallum, Lisa Beech, Kalie Brooks, Kathryn Hughes, Diana Michalek and others an meeting on Fridays at Kathryn's house. They call their working group "The Love Squad".

Katey Downs is now a contributing editor at the <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> (see <a class="wiki" href="http://downs.neozine.org%29/" target="_blank">http://neozine.org/downs)</a>.  As Director of Counseling at Columbus Xenos, Katey brings decades of experience to NeoXenos and the rest of the Web. Katey's counseling is captured in much of our <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics material</a> and was successful with some of the toughest emotional issues.

In related developments:
<ul>
	<li> <strong>We opened a forum for discussing parenting and counseling issues with Katey!</strong></li>
	<li> <strong>Dr. Ankenman has kindly offered to host a seminar for Northeast Ohio Xenos</strong> on disciplining with "Love Authority".</li>
	<li> <strong>A new <a class="wiki" href="http://ethics.neozine.org/" target="_blank">"Love Ethics" section</a> in the NeoZine</strong><a class="wiki wikinew" title="NeoZine&lt;/b&gt;" href="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/tiki-editpage.php?page=NeoZine%3Cb%3E">?</a> is under construction, which will act as a repository of parenting, counseling, and other materials from our classes and research.</li>
</ul>
This week Keith McCallum drove to Cedarville with Katey Downs to spent another day with Dr. Ankenman discussing Love Ethics and reviewing some of the recent <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> posts. He enjoyed the "Punks / Sissies / Bullies / Tramps" paradigm discussed in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, and pointed out that Bullies would be called "Sociopaths" and Tramps would be "Borderline Personalities" in psychiatric terms (in their extremely dysfunctional states).

The additional hours of Ankenman interviews will soon appear in <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> in the Love Ethics section.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos Christian Fellowship is a non-traditional, interdenominational church with mainstream <a href="/about/beliefs" target="_self">biblical doctrines</a>.  In <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home groups</a> we develop   Christian communities <a href="/ministries/leadership" target="_self">led by volunteers</a>.
<p align="center"><img src="http://neoxenos.org/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What Makes Xenos Tick?</h3>
<strong> </strong>Like other Christian Evangelical churches,             we celebrate the Bible's message of freedom and the hope this brings to all humanity through Jesus Christ. We also dump the confusing rituals and traditions wherever the Bible gives us this freedom. Jesus taught about spiritual life and relationships, not <em>religion</em>.

This is why <a href="/ministries">our ministries</a> provide a warm and non-threatening environment             where people can seek God, ask questions, and find out what the Bible actually says. Read about <a href="/about/beliefs">our beliefs</a> to see what's so exciting about this person named Jesus Christ. He was remarkably irreligious, and he was all about personal relationships. Jesus brings a newness to life, called spiritual life, and that's when things get really interesting!

The Bible records the amazing history of God's kind intentions for us. He reveals what it means to be a human with a design and purpose. s He created us like shows us how to build significant lives that impact our families, friends, and the people we meet, and God changes us from confused is this is called Christian maturity. results in <a href="/ministries/leadership">leadership opportunities</a>. (Read about the Bible's <a href="http://neozine.org/inside/2007/significance/">model of significance</a> in our NeoZine).
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<strong> </strong>Xenos began as a home church movement <a href="http://xenos.org">in Columbus</a>,               Ohio where it swelled into a fellowship of about 3,800 adult members               in more than 60 home churches!           At that time, people from Cleveland began asking for the same kind             of informal meeting atmosphere.           In 1994 a Xenos church was first planted in Cleveland, and in 2001 the first Northeast Ohio Xenos church was planted at <a href="/meetings/cbs">Kent State University</a>. Since then we have planted more <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home churches</a> with a thriving <a href="/meetings/homegroups">Central Teaching</a> where everyone comes together in a larger meeting. We maintain a friendly and close           relationship             with <a href="/resources#xenos-links">other           Xenos churches</a> in Ohio. Read about our <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a>.
<h3>What Does the Word "Xenos" Mean?</h3>
<em>Xenos</em> (pronounced <em>zee-noss</em>) is a Greek word meaning             a traveler or someone living outside their native land. When combined             with the Greek word             <em>philo</em>, it             also means friendliness toward strangers, which describes how we open our homes to             others. The name Xenos reminds us that while we’re only temporary             residents on earth, we need to show true love and concern for all             people, especially those we don’t know yet. Xenos Christian             Fellowship welcomes people as they are.
<h3>What Does "NeoXenos" Mean?</h3>
If you lived anywhere near Cleveland you would already know that everything around here begins with "neo", as in "northeastern Ohio". That's because Cleveland is not just Cleveland. It's really a composite of three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland, Akron and Canton (sometimes Youngstown is included, but we prefer to ignore that). Northeast Ohio is a huge "Metropolitan Statistical Area" (MSA) according to the Census Bureau, and we're all over that MSA!

<p style="text-align: left">And we also like to think "NeoXenos" is the "new and improved" <a href="http://xenos.org">Columbus Xenos</a> where we first learned about some things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<strong> </strong>Xenos began as a home church movement <a href="http://xenos.org">in Columbus</a>,               Ohio where it swelled into a fellowship of about 3,800 adult members               in more than 60 home churches!           At that time, people from Cleveland began asking for the same kind             of informal meeting atmosphere.           In 1994 a Xenos church was first planted in Cleveland, and in 2001 the first Northeast Ohio Xenos church was planted at <a href="/meetings/cbs">Kent State University</a>. Since then we have planted more <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home churches</a> with a thriving <a href="/meetings/homegroups">Central Teaching</a> where everyone comes together in a larger meeting. We maintain a friendly and close           relationship             with <a href="/resources#xenos-links">other           Xenos churches</a> in Ohio. Read about our <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a>.
<h3>What Does the Word "Xenos" Mean?</h3>
<em>Xenos</em> (pronounced <em>zee-noss</em>) is a Greek word meaning             a traveler or someone living outside their native land. When combined             with the Greek word             <em>philo</em>, it             also means friendliness toward strangers, which describes how we open our homes to             others. The name Xenos reminds us that while we’re only temporary             residents on earth, we need to show true love and concern for all             people, especially those we don’t know yet. Xenos Christian             Fellowship welcomes people as they are.
<h3>What Does "NeoXenos" Mean?</h3>
If you lived anywhere near Cleveland you would already know that everything around here begins with "neo", as in "northeastern Ohio". That's because Cleveland is not just Cleveland. It's really a composite of three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland, Akron and Canton (sometimes Youngstown is included, but we prefer to ignore that). Northeast Ohio is a huge "Metropolitan Statistical Area" (MSA) according to the Census Bureau, and we're all over that MSA!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos is mostly all about Christian fellowship and Bible studies meeting <a href="/ministries/homegroups">in  homes</a>, at <a href="/meetings/central">Central Teachings</a> and  in a variety of sizes and approaches to fit our modern culture of diversity.

But we also resist elitism or social isolation, and we try to engage our communities and even the diverse cultures outside our experience. With <a href="/meetings/discovery">discussion  groups</a> we build relationships in the neighborhood. Our <a href="http://neoxenos.org/ministries/students">student/youth ministries</a> help kids succeed in school, pursue higher education, build character, and learn how to love their families with greater sacrifice.

It's traditionally called "ministry", but we call it <em><a href="http://neozine.org/ethics/">The Love Ethic</a></em> Jesus taught in the Bible, and it results in the most fruitful life available to humanity. People love Bible studies once they see The Love Ethic touching their hearts like this:
<blockquote>We love, because He first loved us. <em>1 John 4:19</em></blockquote>
This is why people at Xenos are so creative at finding new and different ways to reach others with the Love Ethic of Jesus Christ. We <a href="/ministries/poverty">fight poverty</a> and pursue the <a href="/ministries/missions">global concerns</a> Jesus held for all humanity. These are important ways to reach outside the  local Christian community with genuine concern.

<!--break-->

All these groups require <a href="/ministries/leadership">qualified  leaders</a> and workers who need support, so we provide equpping through  <a href="/ministries/classes" target="_self">Bible  education</a>, <a href="/ministries/resources">online resources</a>, some <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">pastoral  counseling</a>, <a href="/ministries/admin">leadership mentoring</a> (which includes oversight), and finally <a href="/ministries/admin">logistical  support</a> for these efforts, which enables our groups to support each other through various retreats, our <a href="/ministries/finances">financial  ministry</a>, and events like <a href="/about/baptisms">baptisms</a>,  .

But "infrastructure" should never overshadow what really matters:
<blockquote>"What is important  is faith expressing itself in love." (Galatians 5:7, NLT)</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Most Exciting Xenos Ministry!</h3>
Take  away the hassle of church buildings, parking lots and budgets, and what remains?  The simple joy of Christian fellowship!
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="145" /></p>

Christian groups come alive with a "sense of awe" and excitement about God, from  the earliest times (see Acts 2:42). Whenever Christians share the reality of  spiritual life together, they so enjoy Bible teachings, discussions and prayer,  they begin hopping "from house to house," as it says, and it's a sweet time. It's  not a phenomenon limited to Xenos. We've seen it for decades in many Christian  groups, and history is filled with a multitude of such house church movements.

Christianity was the first (and still the only) movement in history set free  from temples, "sacred space" and other religious containments. The Bible clearly  says such "sacred space" actually suppresses the joy Jesus brought (see Hebrews  10).

We've found several advantages to meeting in a home. It's comfortable and  friendly, so people raise issues and add to the teaching. Questions and evidence  for beliefs or biblical assertions can be examined in a friendly manner. But the  greatest advantage is the way closer relationships can form in the Body of  Christ and with newcomers. The Christian faith is designed for personal  relationships, where God's love becomes evident as people care and take interest  in others.

Home churches are an essential part of spiritual growth at Xenos. When average  Christians get an opportunity to use their gifts in significant ways, they  realize even more reasons for learning about Jesus Christ. It's a joy following  him! Besides, the home church meetings are a blast, and this is why they grow  and split.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Deacon Ministry Team</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/dmt-retreat.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="296" height="156" align="right" /></p>

A Ministry Team for Deacons and Workers

<strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong>
The Xenos Deacon Ministry Team (DMT) is a group of people who have volunteered               to               shoulder the burden of serving Christ through accomplishing <a href="/about">our mission</a>. Each member has devoted years of training both in the classroom               and in the               field. Each team works within their own ministry sphere and manifests               the Christian               character described in the Bible's deaconship requirements (1 Timothy             3:8-13).

Mature workers join some of the DMT functions such as retreats or planning sessions. These workers might not be in a position of authority, but they               are actively               helping the church and pursuing deaconship.

<strong>WHY HAVE A DEACON MINISTRY TEAM?</strong>
In any godly church the leaders and workers are Christian                 role models. In 1                 Timothy 3, Paul says that serving as a deacon             is a privilege reserved for those               demonstrating reliability in the field of service. We do not press such character and ministry requirements on all Christians, but leaders must             demonstrate their suitability to that role.

<strong>MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS</strong>
Joining the Deacon Ministry Team requires:
<ul>
	<li>Leading a vital Christian                   spiritual life by maintaining personal times of                   prayer and Bible study.</li>
	<li>Attending and contributing to the <a href="/meetings/central">Central                   Teaching</a> and involved in the spiritual life                   of the church.</li>

	<li>Occupying a leadership role in a Xenos <a href="/ministries">ministry                sphere</a>, such as a cell group,                   teaching, or support ministries.</li>
	<li>Undertaking yearly self-equipping                   projects such as a class or one of the other <a href="/ministries/classes">Equipping Ministry</a> options.</li>
	<li>Practicing mature management of interpersonal conflict                   and handling disagreements in the                   church peacefully.</li>
	<li>Living up to the character qualifications for deacons as                   given in I Timothy                   3. For workers there must be a clear understanding                           of these character                   qualifications and active pursuit underway.</li>
	<li>Regularly attending and participating in                   DMT functions.</li>
	<li>Completing <a href="/ministries/classes">Basic Doctrine                 and Leadership Theology Class</a> or equivalents                   (or finishing LTC               at the next                   possible opportunity).</li>
	<li>Must be unanimously nominated by deacons on that DMT and endorsed                   by the <a href="/about/organization">elders</a>.</li>
	<li>For youth workers and leaders, a background                     check                   may be required.</li>
</ul>
The DMT is an               amazing group of dedicated Christian leaders and workers voluntarily giving their lives as Christ's disciples. Qualifying                             for the team takes years               of work and growth, yet it can become the most rewarding                             experience in the Christian life:
<blockquote>"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses <em>his life</em> will preserve it. <em>Luke 17:33</em></blockquote>
<strong>HOW DOES ONE JOIN THE DMT?</strong>
Deacons and Workers are are invited into the DMT different ways:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Deacons </strong>are ordained ministers at Xenos. After participating in a DMT for a reasonable period and demonstrating stability and perseverance (1 Timothy 3:10), they are unanamously approved by fellow-DMT members for deaconship and approved by the elders. Finally, they must receive the public support of the Body of Christ at large. This entails a reasonable period of time must be allowed so people can provide feedback to any elder or deacon involved. Deacons are recognized at a public fellowship meeting by the elders and their fellow-deacons who pray and "lay on hands" (see 1 Timothy 5:22), thus conferring the authority of church leadership.</li>
	<li><strong>Workers </strong>who qualify                 to attend DMT functions are nominated by the DMT and approved                                               by                   the elders in advance. Workers on the DMT are not ordained ministers, but they are expressly headed that direction.</li>
</ul>
<strong>WHAT DOES THE DEACON MINISTRY TEAM DO?</strong>
<ol>
	<li> All the Deacon Ministry Teams meet annually for ministry review at a planning retreat. This retreat is designed for spiritual edification, and includes the opportunity                                         to study the Bible in-depth and to support one another's                                         ministries through prayer and brainstorming. It is always an exciting and fulfilling                   fellowship of leaders.</li>
	<li>Goals and                     plans for the various ministries in our church are reviewed by the                   DMT at their retreat and periodically throughout                                           the year. Deacons finalize                                           plans for their own ministries and give a presentation to the rest of the fellowship at our annual Fiscal Support Team retreat.</li>
	<li>Each DMT meets on                     regular basis to discuss the ministry of their church.</li>

<title>What Does Xenos Teach?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/bible.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Xenos  Christian Fellowship encourages people of all beliefs and persuasions to  investigate what the Bible teaches. There is no official membership at Xenos or doctrinal tests of purity for anyone participating in our meetings.

However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central to the Christian faith  and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry, so teachers and leaders are educated in <a href="http://neoxenos.org/classes">Bible classes</a> where we affirm all the significant Christian "statements of faith," such as the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the other classical Christian statements of faith. The following is a summary of our core biblical teachings, but feel free to <a href="http://neoxenos.org/about/contact">contact us</a> with any questions.
<h4>The Bible</h4>
The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books that constitute the Bible  are entirely reliable and truthful, and stand as the central authority over our  lives, our faith, and the direction of our church. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).  We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such as the "Chicago  Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."
<h4>The Trinity</h4>
Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to these  persons as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is both self-existent  and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26)
<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and (since his incarnation) fully human. He  lived a sinless life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on  the third day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. (Jn.  1:1,14; Heb. 4:15; 1 Cor. 15:20; Lk. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the only provision  that God has given for people to be reconciled to Him. Christ is also the model  for the Christian life.

<!--break-->

<img src="/files/pictures/old/KeithCT_truefaith.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="191" height="125" align="right" />
<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith in  Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming our  salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life that is  pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also endows each  believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church. (John 14:16;  Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12)
<h4>Salvation</h4>
Salvation is reconciliation with God. God offers us salvation by His grace alone  and we receive it as a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus  Christ. This right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. (Eph.  2:8,9; Gal. 2:16; Jn. 1:12) God freely offers salvation to all people, and our  salvation is secure.
<h4>Humanity</h4>
Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique among all  of God’s creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, we have turned  against God, and this has resulted in spiritual death for all humankind.  Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need which can only be  satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. Without this reconciliation,  all people stand under God’s righteous judgment. Humanity, although fallen,  maintains the image of God and is, therefore, still dignified and unique. God  continues to love us and initiate toward us, even though we are hostile to Him.  Believers in Jesus Christ receive a new nature that becomes the foundation for a  process of transformation. (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<h4>The Church</h4>
The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving faith in  Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but people. God wants all  Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate context. This  context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature of our witness for  Christ. The church is God’s chosen instrument through which the message of  salvation is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the  church. We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the  gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26;  Matthew 28:19)
<h4>Satan</h4>
Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God’s followers. Satan  actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality of Christians.  We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the reality of personal,  spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat and judgment when Christ  returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20)
<h4>The Afterlife</h4>
At the final judgment, God will determine those who will receive eternal life  and those who will live in eternal judgment. Therefore, there is an urgency to  the message of the gospel because eternal issues are at stake. (Matthew 25:46; 2  Thessalonians 1:5-10)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/ct-girls.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="160" height="104" align="left" /> <em>That book is anything but dead!</em> We've seen the Bible reach needs in all  age groups, and it's more relevant today than ever in our fast-paced world where  people are wrestling with how relationships work, or can't satisfy the built-in  need for significance God gave us.

We love sharp minds and tough questions! That's how people discover the Bible is a reliable, historical book which actually dispells superstitions and myths. <em>(Newsflash! The earth is not 6,000  years old, according to the Bible!)</em> It's nice to  know the Bible not only makes sense, but <em>lots</em> of sense.

Shout it out: <em>"Attention, please! You can keep your  intelligence and dig the Bible!"</em> (Maybe not that way.) But it does surprise  people how practical it is, how uptight Jesus <em>isn't,</em> and how it  satisfies our innate drive for <em>significance</em>.

We're always planting new ministry groups that touch the lives of more people  with the freedom and love of Jesus, and we love it. Visit  our <a href="/meetings/times#riverwood">main meeting</a> and see why.

<a href="/ministries/dmt">Leadership Teams</a> of volunteers lead these  groups simply because they enjoy Bible studies and have a burden for people.  Read about what motivates these people and the variety of ways Xenos ministers  to the universities, families and kids in northeast Ohio.
<h3>Central Teaching</h3>
<a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org"><img class="caption" src="/files/pictures/welcome/kmcc-teach.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>It's  our <a href="/meetings/central">largest Bible study</a> and it's definitely not  like "church." First, it meets early Saturday evening for about an hour, not  Sunday morning. (What a way to kickoff Saturday night!) <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Keith  McCallum</a> and other guest speakers dish-up an informative and interesting  Bible study for a broad range of people. <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Visit  Keith's Blog</a> or listen to the <a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">teaching  podcasts</a>. It's more like a (busy) “coffee shop” where people get comfortable,  listen to the teaching and get involved in the open-floor discussion afterwards.  Our snack bar is a mandatory feature, especially on Saturday evening for Marco's  pizza.
<h3>Family-Oriented Ministries</h3>
Jesus loved kids and families, and so do we. <a href="/meetings/central">Central  Teaching</a> provides childcare and cool activities <a href="/ministries/oasis" target="_self">for  children</a> and <a href="/meetings/chill" target="_self">junior  high</a>. The kids love it and complain if they miss a week! There's also <a href="/meetings/jhq" target="_self">JHQ</a> (a.k.a. "Jesus Headquarters") where late-elementary kids have a blast. Other  family-oriented ministries include parenting classes, marriage-building seminars,  and counseling for engaged or married couples and families (read about <a href="http://neozine.org">Love  Ethics</a> at the <a href="http://neozine.org">NeoZine</a>).
<h3>Home Churches</h3>
<a href="/meetings/homegroups">Home  Churches</a> for <a href="/meetings/cbs" target="_self">college-age</a>,  post-college and "Baby-boomers" meet other times during the week. The Bible  studies are well-prepared and challenging, and the fellowship is engaging -- it's  fun to get to know people! These <a href="/ministry/leaders" target="_self">volunteer  teachers</a> and leaders receive advanced training at local <a href="/ministry/leaders" target="_self">Xenos  Bible Classes</a> and <a href="http://www.xenos.org/classes/">in Columbus</a>,  at <a href="http://seminary.ashland.edu/">nearby seminaries</a> and <a href="http://www.the-chapel.org/trinity/">extension  campuses</a>, and extensive personal study. The Bible was written to be  accessible to all Christians and not just a select few (see 1 Pet 2:9), which  explains our rather large number of competent leaders and teachers.
<h3>Student Ministries</h3>
<a href="/ministries/students">Student groups</a> for late elementary,  <a href="/meetings/chill">Junior</a> and <a href="/meetings/word" target="_self">Senior  High</a> meet each week for crazy-fun activities. More than fun, however, these  kids get matured as they develop spiritually by learning more about Jesus and  the Bible. Older students are often helping in younger student groups, and they're  good at it! They all want to bring their friends, and that too is a highly-valued  aspect of <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">Xenos  student ministries</a>.
<h3>Other Services and Ministries</h3>
Read about <a href="/ministries">our ministries</a> to learn more about the  broad range of needs we try to meet through our ministry.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Locating one of our meetings</h3>
<img class="alignright" src="http://neoxenos.org/files/pictures/old/warehouse.jpg" alt="" />Our Bible studies around KSU, the University of Akron and Northeastern Ohio meet in various age groups, times, and sizes. You'll probably find some group or time that suits your style!

Newly-licensed teenage drivers and more seasoned ones are pouring into the spacious parking lot at 1407 Fairchild Avenue…but everyone — especially teenagers — are committed to exercising courteous behavior as guests of Riverwood Community Chapel (one of the many plants from "The Chapel" of Akron).
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/riverwood-map.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<em>The place is called <a href="http://www.riverwoodcommunitychapel.org/">Riverwood  Community Chapel</a>, one of several churches planted by <a href="http://www.the-chapel.org/">the  Chapel of Akron.</a> The group originally met at Kent Roosevelt High School until moving into their current facilities on the border of Stow and Kent. Although it is about two miles from the nearest freeway (Route 8), it is easily located and conveniently near both Akron and Kent State Universities.</em>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Xenos Junior High Ministry</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=12726&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" hspace="5" width="150" height="150" align="left" />As the name implies, this group is dedicated to fun, comfort and a "non-religious" atmosphere. The goal is to get away from religion and learn about the personal impact Jesus makes on lives.</p>
<p>Chill meets every week during the adult Central Teaching, and in other smaller groups for guys and gals.</p>
<p><em>It's not your father's Sunday School! </em>The kids love it and tell their parents, "Gotta Chill!"</p>
<p>They have video presentations, Bible teachings, skits, games, "Fear Factor", overnight retreats, swimming parties, camp outs, Cedar Point, No-Talent Shows, scavenger hunts, Capture the Flag...it's exhausting.</p>
<p>Many in Chill also enjoy going to "Cell Groups" (smalle bible studies), which are more-interactive meetings, smaller and led by adults. Since Cell Groups aren't coed, they lend themselves to the development of deeper, uncomplicated relationships where kids can open up and learn from each other and the group leaders. Always guiding these groups is the study of the Bible and quality personal relationships, which begins with Jesus.</p>
<p>The effect on kids this age is remarkable.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=12679&amp;g2_serialNumber=1" hspace="10" align="right" />Many students develop leadership and teaching skills, becoming role models for younger kids. Mostly they learn how to initiate relationships, build bridges with their families, learn what it means to take responsibility for not only their own lives, but also to care for the needs of others. To see this happening among Junior High kids is a real-world fulfillment of the teachings of Jesus, and why so many people at Xenos love ministry.</p>

<p align="left">The Cuyahoga Falls Bible Study is a church planting movement geared                 towards those in college, post-college and/or careers.</p>
<p align="left">Each week we meet in a casual atmosphere to investigate what the bible has to say. We engage in relevant discussions on what we hear and how it can make an impact on our lives today, even when it smacks against the popular ethos.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like more information on what our many campus bible study is all about, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> about The Falls Project.</p>

We also like to hang out and get to know other on a deeper level. Unlike a superficial clique, we build a supporting                                           network of friends that truly care about one another and are there to share in the challenges of careers and college life.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Keepin' It Real</em><em>!</em></h3>
<div><img class="caption aligncenter" src="/uploads/pictures/welcome/mike-teaching.jpg" alt="" /></div>
Students make the best leaders for student groups if they receive support from adults zealous for life and spiritual growth.<em> These Bible studies kick out tha jams!</em>

These groups are so dynamic and exciting especially because students meet Christ and discover a whole new dimension to life.
<h3>Current Student Groups</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/meetings/jhq">JHQ</a> (for pre-adolescents)</li>
	<li><a href="/meetings/chill">Chill</a> (junior high)</li>
	<li><a href="/meetings/word">Word</a> (high school)</li>
	<li><a href="http://neoxenos.org/meetings/cbs">CBS</a> (college)</li>
</ul>
But the excitement begins even earlier in the <a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS Children’s  Ministry!</a>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is <em>the Crossroads?</em></h3>
<p align="center"><img style="margin-right: 10px" src="http://kmccallum.net/joomla/images/stories/welcome/blackwolf1.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="270" height="183" align="left" /></p>

We like to think of it as an "underground church-planting movement", because it's not about institutions -- it's about people. Our group is led by college-age for college-age.

We know the Bible is at a crossroads with an educated and thinking culture. So we check it out. We <em>talk.</em> We want evidence for faith, not old superstitions. Let’s stick with what matters, not traditions.

When you read about the Jesus in the Bible, he’s profoundly counter-cultural. Jesus builds life, not institutions. He defied the religious assumptions. That’s why they killed him.

Read about us at our <a href="http://thecbs.org">CBS Web</a>. We're pretty loose, easy to meet, fun. That's right. And we're launching the new <a href="http://thecbs.org/theproject">Crossroads Project</a> right now.<a href="http://thecbs.org"></a>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/ct-girls.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="160" height="104" align="left" /> <em>That book is anything but dead!</em> We've seen the Bible reach needs in all  age groups, and it's more relevant today than ever in our fast-paced world where  people are wrestling with how relationships work, or can't satisfy the built-in  need for significance God gave us.

We love sharp minds and tough questions! That's how people discover the Bible is a reliable, historical book which actually dispells superstitions and myths. <em>(Newsflash! The earth is not 6,000  years old, according to the Bible!)</em> It's nice to  know the Bible not only makes sense, but <em>lots</em> of sense.

Shout it out: <em>"Attention, please! You can keep your  intelligence and dig the Bible!"</em> (Maybe not that way.) But it does surprise  people how practical it is, how uptight Jesus <em>isn't,</em> and how it  satisfies our innate drive for <em>significance</em>.

We're always planting new ministry groups that touch the lives of more people  with the freedom and love of Jesus, and we love it. Visit  our <a href="/meetings/times#riverwood">main meeting</a> and see why.

<a href="/ministries/dmt">Leadership Teams</a> of volunteers lead these  groups simply because they enjoy Bible studies and have a burden for people.  Read about what motivates these people and the variety of ways Xenos ministers  to the universities, families and kids in northeast Ohio.
<h3>Central Teaching</h3>
<a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org"><img class="caption" src="/files/pictures/welcome/kmcc-teach.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>It's  our <a href="/meetings/central">largest Bible study</a> and it's definitely not  like "church." First, it meets early Saturday evening for about an hour, not  Sunday morning. (What a way to kickoff Saturday night!) <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Keith  McCallum</a> and other guest speakers dish-up an informative and interesting  Bible study for a broad range of people. <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Visit  Keith's Blog</a> or listen to the <a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">teaching  podcasts</a>. It's more like a (busy) “coffee shop” where people get comfortable,  listen to the teaching and get involved in the open-floor discussion afterwards.  Our snack bar is a mandatory feature, especially on Saturday evening for Marco's  pizza.
<h3>Family-Oriented Ministries</h3>
Jesus loved kids and families, and so do we. <a href="/meetings/central">Central  Teaching</a> provides childcare and cool activities <a href="/ministries/oasis" target="_self">for  children</a> and <a href="/meetings/chill" target="_self">junior  high</a>. The kids love it and complain if they miss a week! There's also <a href="/meetings/jhq" target="_self">JHQ</a> (a.k.a. "Jesus Headquarters") where late-elementary kids have a blast. Other  family-oriented ministries include parenting classes, marriage-building seminars,  and counseling for engaged or married couples and families (read about <a href="http://neozine.org">Love  Ethics</a> at the <a href="http://neozine.org">NeoZine</a>).
<h3>Home Churches</h3>
<a href="/meetings/homegroups">Home  Churches</a> for <a href="/meetings/cbs" target="_self">college-age</a>,  post-college and "Baby-boomers" meet other times during the week. The Bible  studies are well-prepared and challenging, and the fellowship is engaging -- it's  fun to get to know people! These <a href="/ministry/leaders" target="_self">volunteer  teachers</a> and leaders receive advanced training at local <a href="/ministry/leaders" target="_self">Xenos  Bible Classes</a> and <a href="http://www.xenos.org/classes/">in Columbus</a>,  at <a href="http://seminary.ashland.edu/">nearby seminaries</a> and <a href="http://www.the-chapel.org/trinity/">extension  campuses</a>, and extensive personal study. The Bible was written to be  accessible to all Christians and not just a select few (see 1 Pet 2:9), which  explains our rather large number of competent leaders and teachers.
<h3>Student Ministries</h3>
<a href="/ministries/students">Student groups</a> for late elementary,  <a href="/meetings/chill">Junior</a> and <a href="/meetings/word" target="_self">Senior  High</a> meet each week for crazy-fun activities. More than fun, however, these  kids get matured as they develop spiritually by learning more about Jesus and  the Bible. Older students are often helping in younger student groups, and they're  good at it! They all want to bring their friends, and that too is a highly-valued  aspect of <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">Xenos  student ministries</a>.
<h3>Other Services and Ministries</h3>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Also Called "Discovery Groups"</h3>
<img class="alignright" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/show_image.php?id=557" alt="" width="240" height="240" />

Those who attended Gary Poole's seminars on Seeker Small Groups walk away with vision and motivation to reach out to their neighborhoods through question-and-answer "Discussion Groups," as we call them.

It's a tried-and-true Willow Creek way to eliminate the threatening environment where non-Christians feel outnumbered. Discovery Groups turn the table by making the Christians outnumbered!  It's a winner strategy. Several groups were formed, with great results, and more are planned!

Recent Discovery Group topics include the following:
<ul>
	<li> What do you believe about God?</li>
	<li>Who do you think Jesus is?</li>
	<li>What happens after we die?</li>
	<li>What's your assessment of the Bible?</li>
	<li>How could God allow suffering and evil? With subtopics:
<ul>
	<li>Where did evil come from?</li>
	<li>Why doesn't God do something?</li>
	<li>Is the devil for real?</li>
	<li>How could a loving God send people to hell?</li>
	<li>Is there really a heaven?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Our Largest Meeting</h3>
We get together for our Central Teaching (CT) every Saturday at 6:00 PM as guests of  <a href="http://ww.riverwoodchapel.org">Riverwood Chapel</a> in Kent, Ohio. It's a casual and friendly atmosphere, as people eat pizza and hang out. We try to get away from the formalities or traditions which too often get in the way of the  timeless message of Jesus Christ. At our Central Teachings, the ever-present  Snack Bar is a necessity.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/ct-crowd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What's a Central Teaching Look Like?</h3>
People start arriving at CT around 5:30 pm, hang out, eat pizza, drink coffee, and start gabbing!  Sometimes it requires effort to get people in their  seated so the Bible study can begin at 6 pm -- but we usually get started on time. Visitors often remark how surprised they are to discover the relevance and usefulness of the Bible. We engage topics  such as personal growth and our relationships in marriage and family and friends. But we're very interested in the Bible's insights about current events, and we dialog with contemporary world views.

<a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">The teachings</a> cover a broad audience  with diverse backgrounds: from those without much traditional church experience to a wide array of spiritual or religious orientations, including mature Christians. Everyone benefits by learning God's Word at CT.

<!--break-->

After about 45 or 50 minutes the teacher is finished, and then an open-floor  discussion begins. The issues or scriptures studied usually raise questions. These open discussion  can be of great interest for visitors because other people may raise something of common interest. It's a great opportunity to simply observe and see how easy it is to share and talk in this group.

<img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fiddlers.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Then  we pray and bring burdens to God or simply share some thoughts with God. Anyone can pray. It turns the meeting into a real <em>Koinonia</em> (the biblical word for "fellowship").

Then it's time to hang out and talk or whatever else comes up. Often people make plans to go out and "paint the town red!" <em>Koinonia</em> builds an authentic sense of community.
<h3>What About My Kids?</h3>
<a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS</a> offers childcare and classes for all ages during the central teaching, while other <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">student groups </a>carry on their own meetings.
<h3>Why“Central Teaching?”</h3>
Our various <a href="/meetings/homes">home groups</a> come together at this meeting for more in-depth teachings and the animated fellowship a larger meeting offers. Although home groups grow and split, this meeting maintains a continuity of fellowship for everyone. It's also the best place to bring friends or family to investigate the Bible.
<h3>Who Teaches?</h3>
Visit our <a href="/meetings/central">CT podcast site</a> to  listen to Keith McCallum and guest speakers, or visit our <a href="http://neozine.org">online magazine</a> to read about our recent biblical interests.
<h3>How Do I Get There?</h3>
We meet at Riverwood Community Chapel's facility on Saturdays at 6:00. <a href="/meetings/times">See  our directions page</a> for a map and street directions.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos is mostly all about Christian fellowship and Bible studies meeting <a href="/ministries/homegroups">in  homes</a>, at <a href="/meetings/central">Central Teachings</a> and  various <a href="/ministries/students">student groups</a>. But NeoXenos  is not inwardly-focused. We actively pursue <a href="/ministries/poverty">poverty  relief</a>, <a href="/ministries/missions">world missions</a>, community "<a href="/meetings/discovery">Discussion  Groups</a>" (or "Discovery Groups") and other ministries. These are important ways to reach outside the  local Christian community with genuine concern Jesus taught about. People are  starting new and different ministries to reach others with the love of Jesus  Christ all the time.

<!--break-->

All these groups require <a href="/ministries/leadership">qualified  leaders</a> and workers who need support, so we provide equpping through  <a href="/ministries/classes" target="_self">Bible  education</a>, <a href="/ministries/resources">online resources</a>, some <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">pastoral  counseling</a>, <a href="/ministries/admin">leadership mentoring</a> (which includes oversight), and finally the <a href="/ministries/admin">logistical  support</a> these efforts require. Our groups also support each other through <a href="/about/baptisms">baptisms</a>,  various retreats, and our <a href="/ministries/finances">financial  ministry</a>.

But "infrastructure" should never overshadow what really matters, and that's  relationships guided by the biblical principles Jesus taught: "What is important  is faith expressing itself in love." (Galatians 5:7, NLT)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos Christian Fellowship is a non-traditional, interdenominational church with mainstream <a href="/about/beliefs" target="_self">biblical doctrines</a>.  In <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home groups</a> we develop   Christian communities <a href="/ministries/leadership" target="_self">led by volunteers</a>.
<p align="center"><img src="http://neoxenos.org/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What Makes Xenos Unique?</h3>
<strong> </strong>Like other Christian Evangelical churches,             we embrace Christ’s message of hope       and freedom through grace; however, we leave behind the liturgy, rituals, and other traditions where the Bible gives us freedom. <a href="/ministries">Our ministries</a> provide a warm and non-threatening environment             where those seeking God can discover what the Bible says and ask questions. If you read <a href="/about/beliefs">our beliefs</a>, you'll find Jesus is a person, not a "religious" man, and he was all about building personal relationships, not organizations. The best relationship anyone can build is one with him. Then things get really interesting! People to get excited by God's grace and love, and they discover new, deep             and meaningful relationships. All this is unfolds from digging into the riches of God's             Word, and then people start building truly significant lives that impact others and quite often results in <a href="/ministries/leadership">leadership opportunities</a>. (Read about the Bible's <a href="http://neozine.org/inside/2007/significance/">model of significance</a> in our NeoZine).
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<strong> </strong>Xenos began as a home church movement <a href="http://xenos.org">in Columbus</a>,               Ohio where it swelled into a fellowship of about 3,800 adult members               in more than 60 home churches!           At that time, people from Cleveland began asking for the same kind             of informal meeting atmosphere.           In 1994 a Xenos church was first planted in Cleveland, and in 2001 the first Northeast Ohio Xenos church was planted at <a href="/meetings/cbs">Kent State University</a>. Since then we have planted more <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home churches</a> with a thriving <a href="/meetings/homegroups">Central Teaching</a> where everyone comes together in a larger meeting. We maintain a friendly and close           relationship             with <a href="/resources#xenos-links">other           Xenos churches</a> in Ohio. Read about our <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a>.
<h3>What Does the Word "Xenos" Mean?</h3>
<em>Xenos</em> (pronounced <em>zee-noss</em>) is a Greek word meaning             a traveler or someone living outside their native land. When combined             with the Greek word             <em>philo</em>, it             also means friendliness toward strangers, which describes how we open our homes to             others. The name Xenos reminds us that while we’re only temporary             residents on earth, we need to show true love and concern for all             people, especially those we don’t know yet. Xenos Christian             Fellowship welcomes people as they are.
<h3>What Does "NeoXenos" Mean?</h3>
If you lived anywhere near Cleveland you would already know that everything around here begins with "neo", as in "northeastern Ohio". That's because Cleveland is not just Cleveland. It's really a composite of three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland, Akron and Canton (sometimes Youngstown is included, but we prefer to ignore that). Northeast Ohio is a huge "Metropolitan Statistical Area" (MSA) according to the Census Bureau, and we're all over that MSA!

<p style="text-align: left">And we also like to think "NeoXenos" is the "new and improved" <a href="http://xenos.org">Columbus Xenos</a> where we first learned about some things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<strong> </strong>Like other Christian Evangelical churches,             we celebrate the Bible's message of freedom and the hope this brings to all humanity through Jesus Christ. We also dump the confusing rituals and traditions wherever the Bible gives us this freedom. Jesus taught about spiritual life and relationships, not <em>religion</em>.

This is why <a href="/ministries">our ministries</a> provide a warm and non-threatening environment             where people can seek God, ask questions, and find out what the Bible actually says. Read about <a href="/about/beliefs">our beliefs</a> to see what's so exciting about this person named Jesus Christ. He was remarkably irreligious, and he was all about personal relationships. Jesus brings a newness to life, called spiritual life, and that's when things get really interesting!

The Bible records the amazing history of God's kind intentions for us. He reveals what it means to be a human with a design and purpose. s He created us like shows us how to build significant lives that impact our families, friends, and the people we meet, and God changes us from confused is this is called Christian maturity. results in <a href="/ministries/leadership">leadership opportunities</a>. (Read about the Bible's <a href="http://neozine.org/inside/2007/significance/">model of significance</a> in our NeoZine).
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<strong> </strong>Xenos began as a home church movement <a href="http://xenos.org">in Columbus</a>,               Ohio where it swelled into a fellowship of about 3,800 adult members               in more than 60 home churches!           At that time, people from Cleveland began asking for the same kind             of informal meeting atmosphere.           In 1994 a Xenos church was first planted in Cleveland, and in 2001 the first Northeast Ohio Xenos church was planted at <a href="/meetings/cbs">Kent State University</a>. Since then we have planted more <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home churches</a> with a thriving <a href="/meetings/homegroups">Central Teaching</a> where everyone comes together in a larger meeting. We maintain a friendly and close           relationship             with <a href="/resources#xenos-links">other           Xenos churches</a> in Ohio. Read about our <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a>.
<h3>What Does the Word "Xenos" Mean?</h3>
<em>Xenos</em> (pronounced <em>zee-noss</em>) is a Greek word meaning             a traveler or someone living outside their native land. When combined             with the Greek word             <em>philo</em>, it             also means friendliness toward strangers, which describes how we open our homes to             others. The name Xenos reminds us that while we’re only temporary             residents on earth, we need to show true love and concern for all             people, especially those we don’t know yet. Xenos Christian             Fellowship welcomes people as they are.
<h3>What Does "NeoXenos" Mean?</h3>
If you lived anywhere near Cleveland you would already know that everything around here begins with "neo", as in "northeastern Ohio". That's because Cleveland is not just Cleveland. It's really a composite of three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland, Akron and Canton (sometimes Youngstown is included, but we prefer to ignore that). Northeast Ohio is a huge "Metropolitan Statistical Area" (MSA) according to the Census Bureau, and we're all over that MSA!

<title>What Does Xenos Teach?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/bible.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Xenos  Christian Fellowship encourages people of all beliefs and persuasions to  investigate what the Bible teaches. There is no official membership at Xenos or doctrinal tests of purity for those attending Xenos.  However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central to our faith  and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry. We affirm significant  historic creeds of the church, such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.
<h4>The Bible</h4>
The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books that constitute the Bible  are entirely reliable and truthful, and stand as the central authority over our  lives, our faith, and the direction of our church. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).  We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such as the "Chicago  Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."
<h4>The Trinity</h4>
Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to these  persons as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is both self-existent  and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26)
<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and (since his incarnation) fully human. He  lived a sinless life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on  the third day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. (Jn.  1:1,14; Heb. 4:15; 1 Cor. 15:20; Lk. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the only provision  that God has given for people to be reconciled to Him. Christ is also the model  for the Christian life.

<!--break-->

<img src="/files/pictures/old/KeithCT_truefaith.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="191" height="125" align="right" />
<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith in  Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming our  salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life that is  pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also endows each  believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church. (John 14:16;  Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12)
<h4>Salvation</h4>
Salvation is reconciliation with God. God offers us salvation by His grace alone  and we receive it as a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus  Christ. This right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. (Eph.  2:8,9; Gal. 2:16; Jn. 1:12) God freely offers salvation to all people, and our  salvation is secure.
<h4>Humanity</h4>
Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique among all  of God’s creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, we have turned  against God, and this has resulted in spiritual death for all humankind.  Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need which can only be  satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. Without this reconciliation,  all people stand under God’s righteous judgment. Humanity, although fallen,  maintains the image of God and is, therefore, still dignified and unique. God  continues to love us and initiate toward us, even though we are hostile to Him.  Believers in Jesus Christ receive a new nature that becomes the foundation for a  process of transformation. (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<h4>The Church</h4>
The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving faith in  Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but people. God wants all  Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate context. This  context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature of our witness for  Christ. The church is God’s chosen instrument through which the message of  salvation is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the  church. We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the  gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26;  Matthew 28:19)
<h4>Satan</h4>
Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God’s followers. Satan  actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality of Christians.  We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the reality of personal,  spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat and judgment when Christ  returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20)
<h4>The Afterlife</h4>
At the final judgment, God will determine those who will receive eternal life  and those who will live in eternal judgment. Therefore, there is an urgency to  the message of the gospel because eternal issues are at stake. (Matthew 25:46; 2  Thessalonians 1:5-10)]]></content:encoded>

The goal is to get away from religion and learn about the personal impact Jesus makes on lives.</p>
<p>Chill meets every week during the adult Central Teaching, and in other smaller groups for guys and gals.</p>
<p><em>It's not your father's Sunday School! </em>The kids love it and tell their parents, "Gotta Chill!"</p>
<p>They have video presentations, Bible teachings, skits, games, "Fear Factor", overnight retreats, swimming parties, camp outs, Cedar Point, No-Talent Shows, scavenger hunts, Capture the Flag...it's exhausting.</p>
<p>Many in Chill also enjoy going to "Cell Groups" (smalle bible studies), which are more-interactive meetings, smaller and led by adults. Since Cell Groups aren't coed, they lend themselves to the development of deeper, uncomplicated relationships where kids can open up and learn from each other and the group leaders. Always guiding these groups is the study of the Bible and quality personal relationships, which begins with Jesus.</p>
<p>The effect on kids this age is remarkable.</p>

Mostly they learn how to initiate relationships, build bridges with their families, learn what it means to take responsibility for not only their own lives, but also to care for the needs of others. To see this happening among Junior High kids is a real-world fulfillment of the teachings of Jesus, and why so many people at Xenos love ministry.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Our Largest Meeting</h3>
We get together for our Central Teaching (CT) every Saturday at 6:00 PM at  Riverwood. This is a casual, laid-back, and friendly meeting. We think it’s  important that formalities and archaic traditions don’t get in the way of the  timeless message of Jesus Christ. When we setup a Central Teaching, the ever-present  Snack Bar is a necessity.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/ct-crowd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What's a Central Teaching Look Like?</h3>
People start arriving at CT around 5:30 pm, get situated and start gabbing!  People get so engaged it usually requires quite an effort to get people in their  seats so the Bible teaching can begin, at 6 pm. Many visitors remark how  relevant and useful they discovered the Bible actually was. We engage topics  such as relationship-building, marriage, current events, different world views,  how to build strength, and so many other useful revelations found in the Bible.

<a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">The teachings</a> cover a broad audience  with diverse backgrounds: people without much traditional church experience,  those from an array of spiritual or religious orientations, and even the most  mature Christian. Everyone benefits by learning God's Word.

<!--break-->

After about 45 minutes or so the teacher is finished, and then an open-floor  discussion begins. The issues or scriptures studied will always raise questions. These open discussion  can be the most challenging aspect for visitors, because the issues which mystify us so greatly about God arise. It's a great opportunity to simply observe and figure out what kind of group this is.

<img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fiddlers.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Then  we pray and bring burdens to God or simply share some thoughts with God. Anyone can pray. It turns the meeting into a real <em>Koinonia</em> (the biblical word for "fellowship").

Then it's time to hang out and talk or whatever else comes up. Often people make their plans to go out and "paint the town red!" <em>Koinonia</em> builds an authentic sense of community.
<h3>What About My Kids?</h3>
<a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS</a> offers childcare and classes for all ages during the central teaching, while other <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">student groups </a>carry on their own meetings.
<h3>Why“Central Teaching?”</h3>
Our various <a href="/meetings/homes">home groups</a> come together at this meeting for more in-depth teachings and the animated fellowship a larger meeting offers. Although home groups grow and split, this meeting maintains a continuity of fellowship for everyone. It's also the best place to bring friends or family to investigate the Bible.
<h3>Who Teaches?</h3>
Visit our <a href="/meetings/central">CT podcast site</a> to  listen to Keith McCallum and guest speakers, or visit <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Keith's  blog</a> and ask questions.
<h3>How Do I Get There?</h3>
We meet at Riverwood Community Chapel's facility on Saturdays at 6:00. <a href="/meetings/times">See  our directions page</a> for a map and street directions.]]></content:encoded>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/ct-crowd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What's a Central Teaching Look Like?</h3>
People start arriving at CT around 5:30 pm, get situated and start gabbing!  People get so engaged it usually requires quite an effort to get people in their  seats so the Bible teaching can begin, at 6 pm. Many visitors remark how  relevant and useful they discovered the Bible actually was. We engage topics  such as relationship-building, marriage, current events, different world views,  how to build strength, and so many other useful revelations found in the Bible.

<a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">The teachings</a> cover a broad audience  with diverse backgrounds: people without much traditional church experience,  those from an array of spiritual or religious orientations, and even the most  mature Christian. Everyone benefits by learning God's Word.

<!--break-->

After about 45 minutes or so the teacher is finished, and then an open-floor  discussion begins. The issues or scriptures studied will always raise questions. These open discussion  can be the most challenging aspect for visitors, because the issues which mystify us so greatly about God arise. It's a great opportunity to simply observe and figure out what kind of group this is.

<img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fiddlers.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Then  we pray and bring burdens to God or simply share some thoughts with God. Anyone can pray. It turns the meeting into a real <em>Koinonia</em> (the biblical word for "fellowship").

Then it's time to hang out and talk or whatever else comes up. Often people make their plans to go out and "paint the town red!" <em>Koinonia</em> builds an authentic sense of community.
<h3>What About My Kids?</h3>
<a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS</a> offers childcare and classes for all ages during the central teaching, while other <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">student groups </a>carry on their own meetings.
<h3>Why“Central Teaching?”</h3>
Our various <a href="/meetings/homes">home groups</a> come together at this meeting for more in-depth teachings and the animated fellowship a larger meeting offers. Although home groups grow and split, this meeting maintains a continuity of fellowship for everyone. It's also the best place to bring friends or family to investigate the Bible.
<h3>Who Teaches?</h3>
Visit our <a href="/meetings/central">CT podcast site</a> to  listen to Keith McCallum and guest speakers, or visit <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Keith's  blog</a> and ask questions.
<h3>How Do I Get There?</h3>
We meet at Riverwood Community Chapel's facility on Saturdays at 6:00. <a href="/meetings/times">See  our directions page</a> for a map and street directions.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Also Called "Discovery Groups"</h3>
Those who attended Gary Poole's seminars on Seeker Small Groups walk away with vision and motivation to reach out to their neighborhoods through question-and-answer "Discussion Groups," as we call them.

It's a tried-and-true Willow Creek way to eliminate the threatening environment where non-Christians feel outnumbered. Discovery Groups turn the table by making the Christians outnumbered!  It's a winner strategy. Several groups were formed, with great results, and more are planned!
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/show_image.php?id=557" alt="" width="240" height="240" /></p>

Recent Discovery Group topics include the following:
<ul>
	<li> What do you believe about God?</li>
	<li>Who do you think Jesus is?</li>
	<li>What happens after we die?</li>
	<li>What's your assessment of the Bible?</li>
	<li>How could God allow suffering and evil? With subtopics:
<ul>
	<li>Where did evil come from?</li>
	<li>Why doesn't God do something?</li>
	<li>Is the devil for real?</li>
	<li>How could a loving God send people to hell?</li>
	<li>Is there really a heaven?</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/ct-girls.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="160" height="104" align="left" /> <em>That book is anything but dead!</em> We've seen the Bible reach needs in all  age groups, and it's more relevant today than ever in our fast-paced world where  people are wrestling with how relationships work, or can't satisfy the built-in  need for significance God gave us.

We love sharp minds and tough questions! That's how people discover the Bible is a reliable, historical book which actually dispells superstitions and myths. <em>(Newsflash! The earth is not 6,000  years old, according to the Bible!)</em> It's nice to  know the Bible not only makes sense, but <em>lots</em> of sense.

Shout it out: <em>"Attention, please! You can keep your  intelligence and dig the Bible!"</em> (Maybe not that way.) But it does surprise  people how practical it is, how uptight Jesus <em>isn't,</em> and how it  satisfies our innate drive for <em>significance</em>.

We're always planting new ministry groups that touch the lives of more people  with the freedom and love of Jesus, and we love it. Visit  our <a href="/meetings/times#riverwood">main meeting</a> and see why.

<a href="/ministries/dmt">Leadership Teams</a> of volunteers lead these  groups simply because they enjoy Bible studies and have a burden for people.  Read about what motivates these people and the variety of ways Xenos ministers  to the universities, families and kids in northeast Ohio.
<h3>Central Teaching</h3>
<a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org"><img class="caption" src="/files/pictures/welcome/kmcc-teach.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="right" /></a>It's  our <a href="/meetings/central">largest Bible study</a> and it's definitely not  like "church." First, it meets early Saturday evening for about an hour, not  Sunday morning. (What a way to kickoff Saturday night!) <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Keith  McCallum</a> and other guest speakers dish-up an informative and interesting  Bible study for a broad range of people. <a href="http://remonstrance.neoblogs.org">Visit  Keith's Blog</a> or listen to the <a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">teaching  podcasts</a>. It's more like a (busy) “coffee shop” where people get comfortable,  listen to the teaching and get involved in the open-floor discussion afterwards.  Our snack bar is a mandatory feature, especially on Saturday evening for Marco's  pizza.
<h3>Family-Oriented Ministries</h3>
Jesus loved kids and families, and so do we. <a href="/meetings/central">Central  Teaching</a> provides childcare and cool activities <a href="/ministries/oasis" target="_self">for  children</a> and <a href="/meetings/chill" target="_self">junior  high</a>. The kids love it and complain if they miss a week! There's also <a href="/meetings/jhq" target="_self">JHQ</a> (a.k.a. "Jesus Headquarters") where late-elementary kids have a blast. Other  family-oriented ministries include parenting classes, marriage-building seminars,  and counseling for engaged or married couples and families (read about <a href="http://neozine.org">Love  Ethics</a> at the <a href="http://neozine.org">NeoZine</a>).
<h3>Home Churches</h3>
<a href="/meetings/homegroups">Home  Churches</a> for <a href="/meetings/cbs" target="_self">college-age</a>,  post-college and "Baby-boomers" meet other times during the week. The Bible  studies are well-prepared and challenging, and the fellowship is engaging -- it's  fun to get to know people! These <a href="/ministry/leaders" target="_self">volunteer  teachers</a> and leaders receive advanced training at local <a href="/ministry/leaders" target="_self">Xenos  Bible Classes</a> and <a href="http://www.xenos.org/classes/">in Columbus</a>,  at <a href="http://seminary.ashland.edu/">nearby seminaries</a> and <a href="http://www.the-chapel.org/trinity/">extension  campuses</a>, and extensive personal study. The Bible was written to be  accessible to all Christians and not just a select few (see 1 Pet 2:9), which  explains our rather large number of competent leaders and teachers.
<h3>Student Ministries</h3>
<a href="/ministries/students">Student groups</a> for late elementary,  <a href="/meetings/chill">Junior</a> and <a href="/meetings/word" target="_self">Senior  High</a> meet each week for crazy-fun activities. More than fun, however, these  kids get matured as they develop spiritually by learning more about Jesus and  the Bible. Older students are often helping in younger student groups, and they're  good at it! They all want to bring their friends, and that too is a highly-valued  aspect of <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">Xenos  student ministries</a>.
<h3>Other Services and Ministries</h3>
Read about <a href="/ministries">our ministries</a> to learn more about the  broad range of needs we try to meet through our ministry.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos is mostly all about Christian fellowship and Bible studies meeting <a href="/ministries/homegroups">in  homes</a>, at <a href="/meetings/central">Central Teachings</a> and  in a variety of sizes and approaches to fit our modern culture of diversity. But we actively resist elitism or social isolation and to engage with our communities and even the diverse cultures outside our experience. With <a href="/meetings/discovery">discussion  groups</a> we build relationships in the neighborhood. With <a href="http://neoxenos.org/ministries/students">student/youth ministries</a> we help kids succeed in school, pursue higher education, build character, and instruct how to love their families with greater sacrifice.

It's traditionally called "ministry", but we call it <em><a href="http://neozine.org/ethics/">The Love Ethic</a></em> Jesus taught in the Bible, and it results in the most fruitful life available to humanity. People love Bible studies when they see The Love Ethic touching their hearts like this:
<blockquote>We love, because He first loved us. <em>1 John 4:19</em></blockquote>
This is why people at Xenos are so creative at thinking of new and different ways to reach others with the Love Ethic of Jesus Christ. We <a href="/ministries/poverty">fight poverty</a> and pursue the <a href="/ministries/missions">global concerns</a> Jesus held for the plight of all humanity. These are important ways to reach outside the  local Christian community with genuine concern.

<!--break-->

All these groups require <a href="/ministries/leadership">qualified  leaders</a> and workers who need support, so we provide equpping through  <a href="/ministries/classes" target="_self">Bible  education</a>, <a href="/ministries/resources">online resources</a>, some <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">pastoral  counseling</a>, <a href="/ministries/admin">leadership mentoring</a> (which includes oversight), and finally <a href="/ministries/admin">logistical  support</a> for these efforts, which enables our groups to support each other through various retreats, our <a href="/ministries/finances">financial  ministry</a>, and events like <a href="/about/baptisms">baptisms</a>,  .

But "infrastructure" should never overshadow what really matters:
<blockquote>"What is important  is faith expressing itself in love." (Galatians 5:7, NLT)</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>"Jesus Headquarters"</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/images/jhqmeeting.jpg" alt="JHQ Meeting" width="300" height="144" /></p>

The group at “Jesus Headquarters” (JHQ) is a blast for kids fourth through sixth grades. They get together on a separate night from the adult meeting to study the Bible, hang out, and meet new friends. This group provides a place for young people to get ready for middle school by developing a healthy view of themselves, the world, and their peer group.

At each meeting we strive to teach the Bible in a way that kids can really digest at this age. Student leaders from Chill or Word help out and become powerful role models of the healthy, victorious lifestyle that Jesus taught about.

Each week is filled with fun activities, such as skits, games, competitions, and more: amusement Parks, scavenger hunts, laser tag, roller skating....the list is quite exhausting for our volunteers, but rewarding.

More important, these activities offer valuable opportunities to build a peer group while interacting with leaders who provide the support and friendship so important to these pre-adolescent children. For more information about JHQ, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Campus Bible Study (CBS) at KSU</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="http://kmccallum.net/joomla/images/stories/welcome/blackwolf1.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="300" height="203" align="left" /></p>

We like to call the Campus Bible Study (CBS) an "underground church-planting movement," because it's not about institutions, it's about people. It's led by college-age for college-age. <a href="http://thecbs.org">Visit our Web</a>!

We investigate what the Bible has to say. We want evidence for faith, not old superstitions, and relevancy, not traditions. The Jesus of the Bible is profoundly counter-cultural, and he defies the popular ethos. Jesus builds life, not institutions.

We're pretty loose and easy to get to know.The Tuesday hangout is about relationships on a deeper level. Forget campus cliques! We're into friendships and people who care enough to support each other through the crazy college years - and we have a blast doing it!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We now have two home churches now meeting in the Cuyahoga Falls area attended mostly by young adults from the college and early-career age groups. 
<h3>The Cuyahoga Falls Bible Study</h3>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small"> </span></strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/files/pictures/old/KSU_alex_sarah_nicole.jpg" align="left" /></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The Service Ministry at NeoXenos</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/southstreet1.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="192" />All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do. Galatians 2:10</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern. Proverbs 29:7</p>

The Service Ministry is committed to sharing the grace of God and our personal wealth with those less-fortunate, as Jesus taught.

We've formed a great partnership with South Street Ministries,  a non-institutional, very relational ministry to the poor in South Akron. Headed by Duane Crabbs, who spent the beginning of his Christian walk in Xenos Columbus, South Street shares many of our emphases like discipleship, relational evangelism, and indiginous leadership development.

Xenos volunteers work in the after-school program tutoring the underpriviledged. <a href="/drupal/contact">Contact us</a> for more information.]]></content:encoded>

<p>OASIS accommodates children from infants through fifth grade.

<p>All the OASIS leaders and teachers are screened and must be well-known in the  church.

<h3>The JHQ</h3>
<p>The <a href="/meetings/jhq" target="_self">“JHQ”</a> (or “Jesus’ Headquarters”) is a great group for kids in fourth through sixth  grade. They get together on a separate night from the adult meeting to study the  Bible, hang out, and meet new friends. This group provides a place for young  people to get ready for middle school by developing a healthy view of themselves,  the world, and their peer group.</p>
<p>At each meeting we strive to teach the Bible in a way that kids can really  digest at this age. Student leaders from Chill or Word help out and become  powerful role models of the healthy, victorious lifestyle that Jesus taught  about.</p>
<p>Each week is filled with fun activities, such as skits, games, competitions, and  more: amusement parks, scavenger hunts, laser tag, roller skating....the list is  quite exhausting for our volunteers, but rewarding.</p>
<p>More important, these activities offer valuable opportunities to build healthy  peer friendships and interact with leaders.</p>
<p>For more information about JHQ <a href="/contact">contact  the JHQ leaders</a>.</p>

Our goal is to assist  parents in laying a spiritual foundation for their children.</p>
<p>The teaching curriculum is designed to be age-appropriate, emphasizing God’s  grace and love for all humankind.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>All the OASIS leaders and teachers are screened and must be well-known in the  church. These volunteer servants are committed to building meaningful  relationships with the children in their classrooms. For more information about  OASIS, please use our <a href="/contact">contact form</a> to  contact Lisa Beech, the OASIS Director.</p>
<h3>The JHQ</h3>
<p>The <a href="/meetings/jhq" target="_self">“JHQ”</a> (or “Jesus’ Headquarters”) is a great group for kids in fourth through sixth  grade. They get together on a separate night from the adult meeting to study the  Bible, hang out, and meet new friends. This group provides a place for young  people to get ready for middle school by developing a healthy view of themselves,  the world, and their peer group.</p>
<p>At each meeting we strive to teach the Bible in a way that kids can really  digest at this age. Student leaders from Chill or Word help out and become  powerful role models of the healthy, victorious lifestyle that Jesus taught  about.</p>
<p>Each week is filled with fun activities, such as skits, games, competitions, and  more: amusement parks, scavenger hunts, laser tag, roller skating....the list is  quite exhausting for our volunteers, but rewarding.</p>
<p>More important, these activities offer valuable opportunities to build healthy  peer friendships and interact with leaders.</p>
<p>For more information about JHQ <a href="/contact">contact  the JHQ leaders</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Importance of Financial Pledges</h3>
As we finalize plans each year, a key piece is the consideration of our financial needs. The Pledge Program helps us resolve that puzzle.

<img class="caption" src="/drupal/files/pictures/welcome/fstfood.jpg" alt="" align="right" />For years the Pledge Program has received strong support in the fellowship. Everyone has rallied around this               necessity with great charity and open hearts. Paul and the First Century Church likewise used a “Pledge Program”               and advocated regular contributions to it (see 2 Cor. 9:5; 1 Cor.16:2).

Our ministry efforts are either limited or expanded based on these pledges, and past               experience shows that we receive close to what was pledged. By the end of January we hope to complete our financial picture for the coming year, based on the pledges received (see our annual <a href="/ministries/admin#planning">planning schedule</a>).

Beyond financial support, contributors are involved in the <a href="/ministries/fst">Fiscal Support Team</a> (FST). At the annual FST Retreat we come together to review the ministry of the church, offering prayers and support to each other's ministry spheres. What a vital way for everyone to participate in the ministry! Clearly our efforts are beyond human means, and only the Lord’s strength               and miraculous power can bear this kind of fruit.

There are so many servants already donating time and other resources, and yet how amazing it is to see even more sacrificial giving through the financial ministry!               Yet we               all know that “When the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive               the unfading crown of glory” (1 Pet.5:4). As we lay a spiritual               foundation for successive generations of Christians in Northeastern Ohio and the surrounding areas, by God’s grace               let it be said that “they gave as much as they were able,               and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own” (2 Cor.               8:3).

The Xenos Elders]]></content:encoded>

Christ commissioned the church to make disciples of all nations. At <span class="wiki">NeoXenos</span> this commission is central to our mission and vision as a local church. Explore the World Mission pages to find out more about what God is doing through missions teams in other nations and what you can do to support these vital ministries.
<p style="padding-left: 30px">But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, “How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news. Romans 10:14-15</p>

It's a sacrifice of love Americans are loath to make, but working behind the scenes, quietly, patiently, steadily, the passions of NeoXenos leaders and volunteers have proven that we will not stand on the sidelines while billions suffer around the world! Some of our recent activities include:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Deacon Ministry Team</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/dmt-retreat.jpg" hspace="10" width="296" height="156" align="right" /></p>
<p>A Ministry Team for Deacons and Workers</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong><br />The Xenos Deacon Ministry Team (DMT) is a group of people who have volunteered               to               shoulder the burden of serving Christ through accomplishing <a href="/about">our mission</a>. Each member has devoted years of training both in the classroom               and in the               field. Each team works within their own ministry sphere and manifests               the Christian               character described in the Bible's deaconship requirements (1 Timothy             3:8-13).</p>
<p>Mature workers join some of the DMT functions such as retreats or planning sessions. These workers might not be in a position of authority, but they               are actively               helping the church and pursuing deaconship.</p>
<p><strong>WHY HAVE A DEACON MINISTRY TEAM?</strong><br /> In any godly church the leaders and workers are Christian                 role models. In 1                 Timothy 3, Paul says that serving as a deacon             is a privilege reserved for those               demonstrating reliability in the field of service. We do not press such character and ministry requirements on all Christians, but leaders must             demonstrate their suitability to that role.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><strong>MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS</strong><br /> Joining the Deacon Ministry Team requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading a vital Christian                   spiritual life by maintaining personal times of                   prayer and Bible study.</li>
<li>Attending and contributing to the <a href="/ministries/central">Central                   Teaching</a> and involved in the spiritual life                   of the church.</li>
<li>Joining the <a href="/ministries/finances">Fiscal Support Team</a>, which includes regular financial support of the ministry and mission work.</li>
<li>Occupying a leadership role in a Xenos <a href="/ministries">ministry                sphere</a>, such as a cell group,                   teaching, or support ministries.</li>
<li>Undertaking yearly self-equipping                   projects such as a class or one of the other <a href="/ministries/classes">Equipping Ministry</a> options.</li>
<li>Practicing mature management of interpersonal conflict                   and handling disagreements in the                   church peacefully.</li>
<li>Living up to the character qualifications for deacons as                   given in I Timothy                   3. For workers there must be a clear understanding                           of these character                   qualifications and active pursuit underway.</li>
<li>Regularly attending and participating in                   DMT functions.</li>
<li>Completing <a href="/ministries/classes">Basic Doctrine                 and Leadership Theology Class</a> or equivalents                   (or finishing LTC               at the next                   possible opportunity).</li>
<li>Must be unanimously nominated by deacons on that DMT and endorsed                   by the <a href="/ministries/admin">elders</a>.</li>
<li>For youth workers and leaders, a background                     check                   may be required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DMT is an               amazing group of dedicated Christian leaders and workers voluntarily giving their lives as Christ's disciples. Qualifying                             for the team takes years               of work and growth, yet it can become the most rewarding                             experience in the Christian life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses <em>his life</em> will preserve it. <em>Luke 17:33</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HOW DOES ONE JOIN THE DMT?</strong><br />Deacons and Workers are are invited into the DMT different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deacons </strong>are ordained ministers at Xenos. After participating in a DMT for a reasonable period and demonstrating stability and perseverance (1 Timothy 3:10), they are unanamously approved by fellow-DMT members for deaconship and approved by the elders. Finally, they must receive the public support of the Body of Christ at large. This entails a reasonable period of time must be allowed so people can provide feedback to any elder or deacon involved. Deacons are recognized at a public fellowship meeting by the elders and their fellow-deacons who pray and "lay on hands" (see 1 Timothy 5:22), thus conferring the authority of church leadership. </li>
<li><strong>Workers </strong>who qualify                 to attend DMT functions are nominated by the DMT and approved                                               by                   the elders in advance. Workers on the DMT are not ordained ministers, but they are expressly headed that direction. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THE DEACON MINISTRY TEAM DO?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> All the Deacon Ministry Teams meet annually for ministry review at a planning retreat. This retreat is designed for spiritual edification, and includes the opportunity                                         to study the Bible in-depth and to support one another's                                         ministries through prayer and brainstorming. It is always an exciting and fulfilling                   fellowship of leaders.</li>
<li>Goals and                     plans for the various ministries in our church are reviewed by the                   DMT at their retreat and periodically throughout                                           the year. Deacons finalize                                           plans for their own ministries and give a presentation to the rest of the fellowship at our annual Fiscal Support Team retreat.</li>
<li>Each DMT meets on                     regular basis to discuss the ministry of their church. </li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Most Exciting Xenos Ministry!</h3>
Home Groups are smaller groups meeting in homes as the name implies. Take  away the hassle of church buildings, parking lots and budgets, and what remains?  The simple joy of Christian fellowship!
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="145" /></p>

Christian groups come alive with a "sense of awe" and excitement about God, from  the earliest times (see Acts 2:42). Whenever Christians share the reality of  spiritual life together, they so enjoy Bible teachings, discussions and prayer,  they begin hopping "from house to house," as it says, and it's a sweet time. It's  not a phenomenon limited to Xenos. We've seen it for decades in many Christian  groups, and history is filled with a multitude of such house church movements.

Christianity was the first (and still the only) movement in history set free  from temples, "sacred space" and other religious containments. The Bible clearly  says such "sacred space" actually suppresses the joy Jesus brought (see Hebrews  10).

We've found several advantages to meeting in a home. It's comfortable and  friendly, so people raise issues and add to the teaching. Questions and evidence  for beliefs or biblical assertions can be examined in a friendly manner. But the  greatest advantage is the way closer relationships can form in the Body of  Christ and with newcomers. The Christian faith is designed for personal  relationships, where God's love becomes evident as people care and take interest  in others.

Home churches are an essential part of spiritual growth at Xenos. When average  Christians get an opportunity to use their gifts in significant ways, they  realize even more reasons for learning about Jesus Christ. It's a joy following  him! Besides, the home church meetings are a blast, and this is why they grow  and split.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Equipped to Serve Others<br /></h3>
<p>One surprise people discover in the Bible is the way it's written for all  Christians to digest and arrive at conclusions, not just leaders. Unless we are  “equipping the saints for the work of service” (Ephesians 4:12), we aren't doing  the job the Bible expects from us. We're committed to equipping Christians so  they can be “ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account  for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.” (1 Peter 3:15)  It's amazing how many people who "have tasted the good word of God" want to  learn more and more. (Hebrews 6:5)</p>
<p>We offer a number of classes each year like the ones described below (watch the <a href="/news">Neo  News</a> for details).</p>
<!--break-->
<h3>Basic Doctrine</h3>
<p>This class is a <a href="/biblenet/Equipping-Classes-BasicDoctrine/Equipping-Classes-BasicDoctrine">survey  of basic Bible subjects</a>, or doctrines. It's a great way to get a  foundational grasp of the Bible and what Jesus is all about.</p>
<h3>Leadership Theology Class (LTC)</h3>
<p>More substantial Bible <a href="/biblenet/Equipping-Classes-LTC/Equipping-Classes-LTC">courses  for leaders</a> and advanced workers are a series of courses which cover the  range of subjects called a "<a href="/biblenet/Equipping-Classes-LTC-2007/Ltc1-Wk01d-SystematicTheology#sEquipping-Classes-LTC-2007.Ltc1-Wk01d-SystematicTheology_2">systematic  theology</a>." Graduates of Basic Doctrine class engaged in Christian ministry  or teaching need these classes to deepen their Bible knowledge and keep fresh  and challenged. These courses include not only theology but practical  application to everyday life. The LTC series play a strategic role in our  efforts to practice the discipleship Jesus described in Matthew 28.</p>
<h3>Hermeneutics</h3>
<p><a href="/biblenet/Equipping-Classes-LTC-2007/Ltc1-Wk03a-HermeneuticsIntro">Hermeneutics</a> is a highly interactive student-teacher class on the methods of biblical  interpretation. The 10-week class explain various schools of interpretation and  tools for acquiring the discipline of sound interpretation. This includes the  popular Inductive Bible study, historical narrative, wisdom literature, prophets,  gospels, and epistles. Particular emphasis is given to using correct  interpretation for teaching purposes, so the class is designed for those  teaching and leading ministries.</p>
<h3>Homiletics</h3>
<p>This five-week workshop teaches how to compose outlines and develop dynamic,  authoritative teaching skills. Students also present at least two videotaped  teachings and receive feedback from the instructor and other class participants.</p>
<h3>Love Ethics</h3>
<p>The biblical paradigm of spiritual growth is reflected in a community of love.  The <a href="/biblenet/Equipping-Classes-LoveEthics/Equipping-Classes-LoveEthics">Love  Ethics class</a> studies the biblical ethics which build Christian love in all  its spheres of influence: the home, discipleship, and reaching the world for  Christ. Christian love is a practical and well-defined path chosen by God for  our spiritual growth, and this class will help identify many of these practical  implications and their solid biblical foundation.</p>
<h3>Old Testament Survey</h3>
<p>This course traces the unfolding of God's plan through the Old testament, paying  special attention to the history of ancient Israel. The course provides  practical insights to increase understanding of the Old Testament. In addition,  it cultivates an appreciation for the significance of this important part of  Scripture. This course is open to all. It is especially helpful for Christians  who are largely unfamiliar with the Old Testament, its extraordinary message,  and its history.</p>
<h3>New Testament Survey</h3>
<p>New Testament survey explores the ministry and teaching of Jesus and the  expansion of the early church. We study the cultural and historical setting of  the New Testament and survey the major themes of the epistles.  This course offers practical insights to facilitate a solid understanding of the  New Testament. The material provides an important foundation for more advanced  courses that                study New Testament epistles.</p>
<h3>Other Classes</h3>
<p>Other classes in topics such as personal finance and parenting are periodically  offered as well. Visit our <a href="/biblenet/Equipping-Classes/Equipping-Classes">Equipping  Ministry repository</a> for a growing collection of handouts and related class  materials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Oops!</em> We Left Out the 'Organized Religion' Part!</h3>
[caption id="" align="alignright" width="80" caption="Tired of religion?We feel your pain!"]<img class="picture" src="http://www.neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=12643&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" width="80" height="80" />[/caption]

Sorry, we don't have a "church service," but we do get together in lots of  different Bible Studies. We just enjoy Christian fellowship without the formality of church membership, so it's open to anyone. It's where people check out the  Bible and ask questions without getting all uptight and religious about it. Jesus never setup a religion, so why should we?

<!--break-->

<em>And it's a good time!</em>

Who needs all the stuffing? The way he talked about it, Christianity isn't  a religion and never should be. It's more about relationships and lives that work right. It's more about fellowship, not "church". ((<em>A technical (but useful) note:</em> We don't like the word "church" because it's way too confusing. "Church" means something like a "church building" for most people, and that's definitely not what Xenos is all about -- and it's not a term the Bible uses either. "Gathering" or "meeting" is the word used in the Bible, not "church". See <em>"ekklesia</em>" in your Bible study tools.))

We are simply sharing the freedom that comes from knowing about the love Jesus gives us.

<p>Sorry, we don't have a "church service," but we do get together in lots of  different Bible Studies, from small to large.

<p><em>And we have a good time at it!</em></p>
<p>That's what happens when people find the freedom that comes from the love Jesus  taught. Who needs all the stuffing? The way he talked about it, Christianity isn't  a religion and never should be. It's more about relationships that work right.</p>
<p>Our "services" at northeast Ohio Xenos are simply "offering freedom through the  love of Christ" to neighbors, family and friends.</p>
<p>Read about our <a href="/meetings">Bible Studies</a> or <a href="/meetings/times">visit one</a>, learn about our <a href="/ministries">other ministries</a>,  listen to some <a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">podcasts</a>, or read our <a href="http://neozine.org">Zine  (neozine)</a>.

<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>A technical (but useful) Note:</em> We don't like the word "church" because  it's way too confusing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos Administration is undoubtedly the most boring aspect of our ministry, but extremely vital nonetheless.
<h3>Employees</h3>
Katrina Yoerger is our part-time administrative assistant who manages the money flows and other meeting logistics. She reports to the Board of Trustess.

Keith McCallum is a fulltime teacher for Central Teachings and weekly Bible classees. He also manages NeoXenos Bible study and <a href="/resources">research resources</a> made available online, including our online communities.

Other part-time positions change according to ministry needs, such as janitorial services and youth ministry leadership.
<h3>Organization and Constitution</h3>
Xenos is chartered as a non-profit organization under the laws of the state of Ohio. Our constitution is <a href="/files/Constitution-Clev.rtf">available for download</a> (or <a href="http://neoxenos.org/about/organization/constitution">read the online version</a>), and we practice open accounting. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> to obtain our financial report.

<strong>The Board of Trustees</strong> is responsible for general oversight of the ministry, including the distribution of funds and appointment of deacons. Their decisions require a majority vote. Currently our four trustees are Joel Hughes, Keith McCallum, Mark Michalek, and Greg Morsher. See our consitution for more details about their responsibiliites.

<strong>Deacons</strong> lead specific Xenos <a href="/ministries">ministries</a> and belong to the <a href="/ministries/leadership">Deacon Ministry Team</a>. They are ordained ministers who can obtain a state license to solemnize marriages.
<h3><a name="planning"></a>Strategic Planning</h3>
Each year we finalize our budgets and ministry plans through a series of planning and brainstorming retreats.

<strong>The DMT Retreat</strong> brings all the <a href="/ministries/leadership">Deacon Ministry Teams</a> together in the fall, which begins planning for the upcoming year. At this retreat we review each other's ministries and consider what changes and finances these ministries require.

<strong>The Sphere Leader's Retreat</strong> meets at the beginning of the year and reviews the results from the DMT retreat, the budget and finances, and assesses the effectiveness of our ministry efforts. A tentative budget and annual report are the products of this retreat.

<strong>The Fiscal Support Team</strong> (<a href="/ministries/fst">FST</a>) meets in February to approve the budget and propose any changes necessary. The Board of Trustees can then finalize the budget. Any significant deviation from what the FST approved is publicized and may require an additional Body Meeting for additional feedback.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Financial Pledge Program</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Importance of Financial Pledges</h3>
As we finalize plans each year, a key piece is the consideration of our financial needs. The Pledge Program helps us resolve that puzzle.

<img class="caption" src="/drupal/files/pictures/welcome/fstfood.jpg" alt="" align="right" />For years the Pledge Program has received strong support in the fellowship. Everyone has rallied around this               necessity with great charity and open hearts. Paul and the First Century Church likewise used a “Pledge Program”               and advocated regular contributions to it (see 2 Cor. 9:5; 1 Cor.16:2).

Our ministry efforts are either limited or expanded based on these pledges, and past               experience shows that we receive close to what was pledged. By the end of January we hope to complete our financial picture for the coming year, based on the pledges received (see our annual <a href="/ministries/admin#planning">planning schedule</a>).

Beyond financial support, contributors are involved in the <a href="/ministries/fst">Fiscal Support Team</a> (FST). At the annual FST Retreat we come together to review the ministry of the church, offering prayers and support to each other's ministry spheres. What a vital way for everyone to participate in the ministry! Clearly our efforts are beyond human means, and only the Lord’s strength               and miraculous power can bear this kind of fruit.

There are so many servants already donating time and other resources, and yet how amazing it is to see even more sacrificial giving through the financial ministry!               Yet we               all know that “When the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive               the unfading crown of glory” (1 Pet.5:4). As we lay a spiritual               foundation for successive generations of Christians in Northeastern Ohio and the surrounding areas, by God’s grace               let it be said that “they gave as much as they were able,               and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own” (2 Cor.               8:3).

Your Servants in Christ,
The Xenos Elders]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Financial Ministries - Finance Overview</h3>
<h4>Your support is important to us!</h4>
Xenos is entirely funded by voluntary contributions, and your support enables us  to grow and operate in Northeastern Ohio. We are a tax-exempt, non-profit  organization incorporated under the laws of Ohio. We practice open accounting on  all our finances.

<div class="caption" style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fst-presentation.jpg" alt="" width="357" height="207" /></div>
<h3>How Is Our Money Spent?</h3>
<ul>
	<li> The <a href="/meetings/homegroups" target="_self">Adult          Ministries</a> budget includes the cost of our <a href="/meetings/central" target="_self">Central          Teaching</a>, its teachers and <a href="/meetings/oasis" target="_self">Children's          Program</a>. We are also planting family-aged, local home Bible studies which          require oversight and provision from ministry staff.</li>
	<li> In <a href="/meetings/students" target="_self">Student          Ministries</a> we are actively building new ministries among late elementary,          junior and senior high school ages. These meetings require logistical support,          ministry staff provision and oversight.</li>
	<li> Our <a href="/meetings/cbs" target="_self">College          Ministries</a> consist of home groups in the Kent State and Akron University          areas, which also receive provision, oversight and logistical support from your          donations.</li>
	<li> We provide <a href="/ministries/classes" target="_self">Equipping          and Training</a> for leaders, advanced workers and young                          Christians through regular Bible classes and paid teachers. We                          offer a growing collection of <a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">audio          teachings</a>, tape catalogs and <a href="/resources" target="_self">Web-based resources</a> for Bible teachers and students. Please visit the <a href="http://neonets.org/">NeoZine</a>, our on-line magazine.</li>

<p align="left">The Cuyahoga Falls Bible Study is a church planting movement geared                 towards those in college, post-college and/or careers.</p>
<p align="left">Each week we meet in a casual atmosphere to investigate what the bible has to say. We engage in relevant discussions on what we hear and how it can make an impact on our lives today, even when it smacks against the popular ethos.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like more information on what our many campus bible study is all about, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> about The Falls Project.</p>

We also like to hang out and get to know other on a deeper level. Unlike a superficial clique, we build a supporting                                           network of friends that truly care about one another and are there to share in the challenges of careers and college life.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Campus Bible Study (CBS) at KSU</h3>
<p align="center"><img style="margin-right: 10px" src="http://kmccallum.net/joomla/images/stories/welcome/blackwolf1.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="270" height="183" align="left" /></p>

We like to think of it as an "underground church-planting movement" because it's not about institutions -- it's about people. Our group is led by college-age for college-age.

We check out what the Bible has to say. We want evidence for faith, not old superstitions, and relevancy, not traditions. Jesus in the Bible is profoundly counter-cultural, and he defies the popular ethos. Jesus builds life, not institutions.

We're pretty loose and easy to get to know.The Tuesday hangout is about relationships on a deeper level. Forget about mind games! We're into friendships and people who care enough to support each other through the crazy college years - and we have a blast doing it!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Most Exciting Xenos Ministry!</h3>
Take  away the hassle of church buildings, parking lots and budgets, and what remains?  The simple joy of Christian fellowship!
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="145" /></p>

Christian groups come alive with a "sense of awe" and excitement about God, from  the earliest times (see Acts 2:42). Whenever Christians share the reality of  spiritual life together, they so enjoy Bible teachings, discussions and prayer,  they begin hopping "from house to house," as it says, and it's a sweet time. It's  not a phenomenon limited to Xenos. We've seen it for decades in many Christian  groups, and history is filled with a multitude of such house church movements.

Christianity was the first (and still the only) movement in history set free  from temples, "sacred space" and other religious containments. The Bible clearly  says such "sacred space" actually suppresses the joy Jesus brought (see Hebrews  10).

We've found several advantages to meeting in a home. It's comfortable and  friendly, so people raise issues and add to the teaching. Questions and evidence  for beliefs or biblical assertions can be examined in a friendly manner. But the  greatest advantage is the way closer relationships can form in the Body of  Christ and with newcomers. The Christian faith is designed for personal  relationships, where God's love becomes evident as people care and take interest  in others.

Home churches are an essential part of spiritual growth at Xenos. When average  Christians get an opportunity to use their gifts in significant ways, they  realize even more reasons for learning about Jesus Christ. It's a joy following  him! Besides, the home church meetings are a blast, and this is why they grow  and split.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Oops!</em> We Left Out the 'Organized Religion' Part!</h3>
<div style="float:right;padding: 10px"><img class="picture" src="http://www.neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=12643&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="If you're tired of religion, we know what you mean" width="80" height="80" />
<em>Tired of religion?
We feel your pain!</em></div>
Sorry, we don't have a "church service," but we do get together in lots of  different Bible Studies. We just enjoy Christian fellowship without the formality of church membership, so it's open to anyone. It's where people check out the  Bible and ask questions without getting all uptight and religious about it. Jesus never setup a religion, so why should we?

<!--break-->

<em>And it's a good time!</em>

Who needs all the stuffing? The way he talked about it, Christianity isn't  a religion and never should be. It's more about relationships and lives that work right. It's more about fellowship, not "church". ((<em>A technical (but useful) note:</em> We don't like the word "church" because it's way too confusing. "Church" means something like a "church building" for most people, and that's definitely not what Xenos is all about -- and it's not a term the Bible uses either. "Gathering" or "meeting" is the word used in the Bible, not "church". See <em>"ekklesia</em>" in your Bible study tools.))

We are simply sharing the freedom that comes from knowing about the love Jesus gives us.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Oops!</em> We Left Out the 'Organized Religion' Part!</h3>

Sorry, we don't have a "church service," but we do get together in lots of  different Bible Studies. We just enjoy Christian fellowship without the formality of church membership, so it's open to anyone. It's where people check out the  Bible and ask questions without getting all uptight and religious about it. Jesus never setup a religion, so why should we?

<em>And it's a good time!</em>

Who needs all the stuffing? The way he talked about it, Christianity isn't  a religion and never should be. It's more about relationships and lives that work right. It's more about fellowship, not "church". ((<em>A technical (but useful) note:</em> We don't like the word "church" because it's way too confusing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/bible.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Xenos  Christian Fellowship encourages people of all beliefs and persuasions to  investigate what the Bible teaches. There is no official membership at Xenos or doctrinal tests of purity for anyone just attending Xenos.  However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central to the Christian faith  and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry, so teachers and leaders are educated in <a href="http://neoxenos.org/classes">Bible classes</a> where we affirm all the significant Christian "statements of faith," such as the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the other classics. The following is a summary of our core biblical teachings.
<h4>The Bible</h4>
The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books that constitute the Bible  are entirely reliable and truthful, and stand as the central authority over our  lives, our faith, and the direction of our church. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).  We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such as the "Chicago  Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."
<h4>The Trinity</h4>
Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to these  persons as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is both self-existent  and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26)
<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and (since his incarnation) fully human. He  lived a sinless life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on  the third day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. (Jn.  1:1,14; Heb. 4:15; 1 Cor. 15:20; Lk. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the only provision  that God has given for people to be reconciled to Him. Christ is also the model  for the Christian life.

<!--break-->

<img src="/files/pictures/old/KeithCT_truefaith.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="191" height="125" align="right" />
<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith in  Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming our  salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life that is  pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also endows each  believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church. (John 14:16;  Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12)
<h4>Salvation</h4>
Salvation is reconciliation with God. God offers us salvation by His grace alone  and we receive it as a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus  Christ. This right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. (Eph.  2:8,9; Gal. 2:16; Jn. 1:12) God freely offers salvation to all people, and our  salvation is secure.
<h4>Humanity</h4>
Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique among all  of God’s creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, we have turned  against God, and this has resulted in spiritual death for all humankind.  Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need which can only be  satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. Without this reconciliation,  all people stand under God’s righteous judgment. Humanity, although fallen,  maintains the image of God and is, therefore, still dignified and unique. God  continues to love us and initiate toward us, even though we are hostile to Him.  Believers in Jesus Christ receive a new nature that becomes the foundation for a  process of transformation. (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<h4>The Church</h4>
The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving faith in  Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but people. God wants all  Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate context. This  context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature of our witness for  Christ. The church is God’s chosen instrument through which the message of  salvation is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the  church. We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the  gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26;  Matthew 28:19)
<h4>Satan</h4>
Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God’s followers. Satan  actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality of Christians.  We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the reality of personal,  spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat and judgment when Christ  returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20)
<h4>The Afterlife</h4>
At the final judgment, God will determine those who will receive eternal life  and those who will live in eternal judgment. Therefore, there is an urgency to  the message of the gospel because eternal issues are at stake. (Matthew 25:46; 2  Thessalonians 1:5-10)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Our Largest Meeting</h3>
We get together for our Central Teaching (CT) every Saturday at 6:00 PM as guests of  <a href="http://ww.riverwoodchapel.org">Riverwood Chapel</a> in Kent, Ohio. It's a casual and friendly atmosphere, as people eat pizza and hang out. We try to get away from the formalities or traditions which too often get in the way of the  timeless message of Jesus Christ. At our Central Teachings, the ever-present  Snack Bar is a necessity.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/ct-crowd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What's a Central Teaching Look Like?</h3>
People start arriving at CT around 5:30 pm, hang out, eat pizza, drink coffee, and start gabbing!  People get so engaged it usually requires quite an effort to get people in their  seats so the Bible teaching can begin, at 6 pm. Many visitors remark how  relevant and useful they discovered the Bible actually was. We engage topics  such as relationship-building, marriage, current events, different world views,  how to build strength, and so many other useful revelations found in the Bible.

<a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">The teachings</a> cover a broad audience  with diverse backgrounds: people without much traditional church experience,  those from an array of spiritual or religious orientations, and even the most  mature Christian. Everyone benefits by learning God's Word.

<!--break-->

After about 45 minutes or so the teacher is finished, and then an open-floor  discussion begins. The issues or scriptures studied will always raise questions. These open discussion  can be the most challenging aspect for visitors, because the issues which mystify us so greatly about God arise. It's a great opportunity to simply observe and figure out what kind of group this is.

<img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fiddlers.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Then  we pray and bring burdens to God or simply share some thoughts with God. Anyone can pray. It turns the meeting into a real <em>Koinonia</em> (the biblical word for "fellowship").

Then it's time to hang out and talk or whatever else comes up. Often people make their plans to go out and "paint the town red!" <em>Koinonia</em> builds an authentic sense of community.
<h3>What About My Kids?</h3>
<a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS</a> offers childcare and classes for all ages during the central teaching, while other <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">student groups </a>carry on their own meetings.
<h3>Why“Central Teaching?”</h3>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Our Largest Meeting</h3>
We get together for our Central Teaching (CT) every Saturday at 6:00 PM as guests of  <a href="http://ww.riverwoodchapel.org">Riverwood Chapel</a> in Kent, Ohio. It's a casual and friendly atmosphere, as people eat pizza and hang out. We try to get away from the formalities or traditions which too often get in the way of the  timeless message of Jesus Christ. At our Central Teachings, the ever-present  Snack Bar is a necessity.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/ct-crowd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What's a Central Teaching Look Like?</h3>
People start arriving at CT around 5:30 pm, hang out, eat pizza, drink coffee, and start gabbing!  Sometimes it requires effort to get people in their  seated so the Bible study can begin at 6 pm -- but we usually get started on time. Visitors often remark how surprised they are to discover the relevance and usefulness of the Bible. We engage topics  such as personal growth and our relationships in marriage and family and friends. But we're very interested in the Bible's insights about current events, and we dialog with contemporary world views.

<a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">The teachings</a> cover a broad audience  with diverse backgrounds: from those without much traditional church experience to a wide array of spiritual or religious orientations, including mature Christians. Everyone benefits by learning God's Word at CT.

<!--break-->

After about 45 or 50 minutes the teacher is finished, and then an open-floor  discussion begins. The issues or scriptures studied usually raise questions. These open discussion  can be of great interest for visitors because other people may raise something of common interest. It's a great opportunity to simply observe and see how easy it is to share and talk in this group.

<img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fiddlers.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Then  we pray and bring burdens to God or simply share some thoughts with God. Anyone can pray. It turns the meeting into a real <em>Koinonia</em> (the biblical word for "fellowship").

Then it's time to hang out and talk or whatever else comes up. Often people make plans to go out and "paint the town red!" <em>Koinonia</em> builds an authentic sense of community.
<h3>What About My Kids?</h3>
<a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS</a> offers childcare and classes for all ages during the central teaching, while other <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">student groups </a>carry on their own meetings.
<h3>Why“Central Teaching?”</h3>
Our various <a href="/meetings/homes">home groups</a> come together at this meeting for more in-depth teachings and the animated fellowship a larger meeting offers. Although home groups grow and split, this meeting maintains a continuity of fellowship for everyone. It's also the best place to bring friends or family to investigate the Bible.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos Administration is undoubtedly the most boring aspect of our ministry, but extremely vital nonetheless.
<h3>Employees</h3>
Katrina Yoerger is our part-time administrative assistant who manages the money flows and other meeting logistics. She reports to the Board of Trustess.

Keith McCallum is a fulltime teacher for Central Teachings and weekly Bible classees. He also manages NeoXenos Bible study and <a href="/resources">research resources</a> made available online, including our online communities.

Other part-time positions change according to ministry needs, such as janitorial services and youth ministry leadership.
<h3>Organization and Constitution</h3>
Xenos is chartered as a non-profit organization under the laws of the state of Ohio. Our constitution is <a href="/files/Constitution-Clev.rtf">available for download</a> (or read the online version), and we practice open accounting. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> to obtain our financial report.

<strong>The Board of Trustees</strong> is responsible for general oversight of the ministry, including the distribution of funds and appointment of deacons. Their decisions require a majority vote. Currently our four trustees are Joel Hughes, Keith McCallum, Mark Michalek, and Greg Morsher. See our consitution for more details about their responsibiliites.

<strong>Deacons</strong> lead specific Xenos <a href="/ministries">ministries</a> and belong to the <a href="/ministries/leadership">Deacon Ministry Team</a>. They are ordained ministers who can obtain a state license to solemnize marriages.
<h3><a name="planning"></a>Strategic Planning</h3>
Each year we finalize our budgets and ministry plans through a series of planning and brainstorming retreats.

<strong>The DMT Retreat</strong> brings all the <a href="/ministries/leadership">Deacon Ministry Teams</a> together in the fall, which begins planning for the upcoming year. At this retreat we review each other's ministries and consider what changes and finances these ministries require.

<strong>The Sphere Leader's Retreat</strong> meets at the beginning of the year and reviews the results from the DMT retreat, the budget and finances, and assesses the effectiveness of our ministry efforts. A tentative budget and annual report are the products of this retreat.

<strong>The Fiscal Support Team</strong> (<a href="/ministries/fst">FST</a>) meets in February to approve the budget and propose any changes necessary. The Board of Trustees can then finalize the budget. Any significant deviation from what the FST approved is publicized and may require an additional Body Meeting for additional feedback.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Deacon Ministry Team</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/dmt-retreat.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="296" height="156" align="right" /></p>

A Ministry Team for Deacons and Workers

<strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong>
The Xenos Deacon Ministry Team (DMT) is a group of people who have volunteered               to               shoulder the burden of serving Christ through accomplishing <a href="/about">our mission</a>. Each member has devoted years of training both in the classroom               and in the               field. Each team works within their own ministry sphere and manifests               the Christian               character described in the Bible's deaconship requirements (1 Timothy             3:8-13).

Mature workers join some of the DMT functions such as retreats or planning sessions. These workers might not be in a position of authority, but they               are actively               helping the church and pursuing deaconship.

<strong>WHY HAVE A DEACON MINISTRY TEAM?</strong>
In any godly church the leaders and workers are Christian                 role models. In 1                 Timothy 3, Paul says that serving as a deacon             is a privilege reserved for those               demonstrating reliability in the field of service. We do not press such character and ministry requirements on all Christians, but leaders must             demonstrate their suitability to that role.

<!--break-->

<strong>MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS</strong>
Joining the Deacon Ministry Team requires:
<ul>
	<li>Leading a vital Christian                   spiritual life by maintaining personal times of                   prayer and Bible study.</li>
	<li>Attending and contributing to the <a href="/meetings/central">Central                   Teaching</a> and involved in the spiritual life                   of the church.</li>
	<li>Joining the <a href="/ministries/finances">Fiscal Support Team</a>, which includes regular financial support of the ministry and mission work.</li>
	<li>Occupying a leadership role in a Xenos <a href="/ministries">ministry                sphere</a>, such as a cell group,                   teaching, or support ministries.</li>
	<li>Undertaking yearly self-equipping                   projects such as a class or one of the other <a href="/ministries/classes">Equipping Ministry</a> options.</li>
	<li>Practicing mature management of interpersonal conflict                   and handling disagreements in the                   church peacefully.</li>
	<li>Living up to the character qualifications for deacons as                   given in I Timothy                   3. For workers there must be a clear understanding                           of these character                   qualifications and active pursuit underway.</li>
	<li>Regularly attending and participating in                   DMT functions.</li>
	<li>Completing <a href="/ministries/classes">Basic Doctrine                 and Leadership Theology Class</a> or equivalents                   (or finishing LTC               at the next                   possible opportunity).</li>
	<li>Must be unanimously nominated by deacons on that DMT and endorsed                   by the <a href="/ministries/admin">elders</a>.</li>
	<li>For youth workers and leaders, a background                     check                   may be required.</li>
</ul>
The DMT is an               amazing group of dedicated Christian leaders and workers voluntarily giving their lives as Christ's disciples. Qualifying                             for the team takes years               of work and growth, yet it can become the most rewarding                             experience in the Christian life:
<blockquote>"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses <em>his life</em> will preserve it. <em>Luke 17:33</em></blockquote>
<strong>HOW DOES ONE JOIN THE DMT?</strong>
Deacons and Workers are are invited into the DMT different ways:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Deacons </strong>are ordained ministers at Xenos. After participating in a DMT for a reasonable period and demonstrating stability and perseverance (1 Timothy 3:10), they are unanamously approved by fellow-DMT members for deaconship and approved by the elders. Finally, they must receive the public support of the Body of Christ at large. This entails a reasonable period of time must be allowed so people can provide feedback to any elder or deacon involved. Deacons are recognized at a public fellowship meeting by the elders and their fellow-deacons who pray and "lay on hands" (see 1 Timothy 5:22), thus conferring the authority of church leadership.</li>
	<li><strong>Workers </strong>who qualify                 to attend DMT functions are nominated by the DMT and approved                                               by                   the elders in advance. Workers on the DMT are not ordained ministers, but they are expressly headed that direction.</li>
</ul>
<strong>WHAT DOES THE DEACON MINISTRY TEAM DO?</strong>
<ol>
	<li> All the Deacon Ministry Teams meet annually for ministry review at a planning retreat. This retreat is designed for spiritual edification, and includes the opportunity                                         to study the Bible in-depth and to support one another's                                         ministries through prayer and brainstorming. It is always an exciting and fulfilling                   fellowship of leaders.</li>
	<li>Goals and                     plans for the various ministries in our church are reviewed by the                   DMT at their retreat and periodically throughout                                           the year. Deacons finalize                                           plans for their own ministries and give a presentation to the rest of the fellowship at our annual Fiscal Support Team retreat.</li>
	<li>Each DMT meets on                     regular basis to discuss the ministry of their church.</li>

Newly-licensed teenage drivers and more seasoned ones are pouring into the spacious parking lot at 1407 Fairchild Avenue…but everyone — especially teenagers — are committed to exercising courteous behavior as guests of Riverwood Community Chapel (one of the many plants from "The Chapel" of Akron).

<em>The place is called <a href="http://www.riverwoodcommunitychapel.org/">Riverwood  Community Chapel</a>, one of several churches planted by <a href="http://www.the-chapel.org/">the  Chapel of Akron.</a> The group originally met at Kent Roosevelt High School until moving into their current facilities on the border of Stow and Kent.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>"Jesus Headquarters"</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/images/jhqmeeting.jpg" alt="JHQ Meeting" width="300" height="144" /></p>

The group at “Jesus Headquarters” (JHQ) is a blast for kids fourth through sixth grades. They get together on a separate night from the adult meeting to study the Bible, hang out, and meet new friends. This group provides a place for young people to get ready for middle school by developing a healthy view of themselves, the world, and their peer group.

At each meeting we strive to teach the Bible in a way that kids can really digest at this age. Student leaders from Chill or Word help out and become powerful role models of the healthy, victorious lifestyle that Jesus taught about.

Each week is filled with fun activities, such as skits, games, competitions, and more: amusement Parks, scavenger hunts, laser tag, roller skating....the list is quite exhausting for our volunteers, but rewarding.

More important, these activities offer valuable opportunities to build a peer group while interacting with leaders who provide the support and friendship so important to these pre-adolescent children. For more information about JHQ, please <a href="/ministries/contact">contact us</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em>Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples, “Let the      children come to me. Don’t stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those      who are like these children..."</em> <em>Luke 18:16-17 (NLT)</em></blockquote>
<img src="http://www.neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=6979&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" hspace="10" width="141" height="141" align="left" />

The kids turn Saturday evenings into a beehive of activity at Central Teaching.  We offer child care and children's classes, but it's really much more. Just ask  the kids. They hate to miss a week!

The teachers are enthusiastic about the Bible lesson, which also includes crafts,  games, or contests for the smaller ones. It's never a boring lecture.

<em>And then begins the </em><em>real fun!</em> The leaders get the kids playing,  engaging, talking and these kids are often impacted for a lifetime with a  positive experience learning about Jesus. Two major ministries led by qualified  leaders and teachers serve these kids.
<h3>OASIS</h3>
At OASIS we not only value children, but we recognize the importance of  providing a safe setting where they can experience and learn more about Jesus  Christ. Our model is to be "Secure, Accessible, Fun and Educational" (S.A.F.E.)!

OASIS accommodates children from infants through fifth grade. At each level,  volunteer directors make a long-term commitment to see that the children receive  care and useful teachings during all Central Teachings. Our goal is to assist  parents in laying a spiritual foundation for their children.

The teaching curriculum is designed to be age-appropriate, emphasizing God’s  grace and love for all humankind.

<!--break-->

All the OASIS leaders and teachers are screened and must be well-known in the  church. These volunteer servants are committed to building meaningful  relationships with the children in their classrooms. For more information about  OASIS, please use our <a href="/contact">contact form</a> to  contact Lisa Beech, the OASIS Director.
<h3>The JHQ</h3>
The <a href="/meetings/jhq" target="_self">“JHQ”</a> (or “Jesus’ Headquarters”) is a great group for kids in fourth through sixth  grade. Read about it on the <a href="http://neoxenos.org/meetings/jhq">JHQ Meeting page</a>.  Kids in the JHQ also meet on Saturday evening during the adult Central Teaching.

The group at “Jesus Headquarters” (JHQ) is a blast for kids fourth through sixth grades. They get together on a separate night from the adult meeting to study the Bible, hang out, and meet new friends. This group provides a place for young people to get ready for middle school by developing a healthy view of themselves, the world, and their peer group.

[php]return "nHello from PHPn";[/php]

At each meeting we strive to teach the Bible in a way that kids can really digest at this age. Student leaders from Chill or Word help out and become powerful role models of the healthy, victorious lifestyle that Jesus taught about.

Each week is filled with fun activities, such as skits, games, competitions, and more: amusement Parks, scavenger hunts, laser tag, roller skating....the list is quite exhausting for our volunteers, but rewarding.

More important, these activities offer valuable opportunities to build a peer group while interacting with leaders who provide the support and friendship so important to these pre-adolescent children. For more information about JHQ, please <a href="/ministries/contact">contact us</a>.]]></content:encoded>

This group provides a place for young people to get ready for middle school by developing a healthy view of themselves, the world, and their peer group.

[php]return "Hello";[/php]

At each meeting we strive to teach the Bible in a way that kids can really digest at this age. Student leaders from Chill or Word help out and become powerful role models of the healthy, victorious lifestyle that Jesus taught about.

Each week is filled with fun activities, such as skits, games, competitions, and more: amusement Parks, scavenger hunts, laser tag, roller skating....the list is quite exhausting for our volunteers, but rewarding.

More important, these activities offer valuable opportunities to build a peer group while interacting with leaders who provide the support and friendship so important to these pre-adolescent children.

Sorry, we don't have a "church service," but we do get together in lots of  different Bible Studies. We just enjoy Christian fellowship without the formality of church membership, so it's open to anyone. It's where people check out the  Bible and ask questions without getting all uptight and religious about it. Jesus never setup a religion, so why should we?

<!--break-->

<em>And it's a good time!</em>

Who needs all the stuffing? The way he talked about it, Christianity isn't  a religion and never should be. It's more about relationships and lives that work right. It's more about fellowship, not "church". ((<em>A technical (but useful) note:</em> We don't like the word "church" because it's way too confusing. "Church" means something like a "church building" for most people, and that's definitely not what Xenos is all about -- and it's not a term the Bible uses either. "Gathering" or "meeting" is the word used in the Bible, not "church". See <em>"ekklesia</em>" in your Bible study tools.))

We are simply sharing the freedom that comes from knowing about the love Jesus gives us.

<title>What Does Xenos Teach?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/bible.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Xenos  Christian Fellowship encourages people of all beliefs and persuasions to  investigate what the Bible teaches. There is no official membership at Xenos or doctrinal tests of purity for anyone just attending Xenos.  However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central to the Christian faith  and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry, so teachers and leaders are educated in <a href="http://neoxenos.org/classes">Bible classes</a> where we affirm all the significant Christian "statements of faith," such as the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the other classics. The following is a summary of our core biblical teachings, but feel free to <a href="http://neoxenos.org/about/contact">contact us</a> with any questions.
<h4>The Bible</h4>
The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books that constitute the Bible  are entirely reliable and truthful, and stand as the central authority over our  lives, our faith, and the direction of our church. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).  We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such as the "Chicago  Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."
<h4>The Trinity</h4>
Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to these  persons as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is both self-existent  and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26)
<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and (since his incarnation) fully human. He  lived a sinless life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on  the third day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. (Jn.  1:1,14; Heb. 4:15; 1 Cor. 15:20; Lk. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the only provision  that God has given for people to be reconciled to Him. Christ is also the model  for the Christian life.

<!--break-->

<img src="/files/pictures/old/KeithCT_truefaith.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="191" height="125" align="right" />
<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith in  Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming our  salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life that is  pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also endows each  believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church. (John 14:16;  Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12)
<h4>Salvation</h4>
Salvation is reconciliation with God. God offers us salvation by His grace alone  and we receive it as a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus  Christ. This right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. (Eph.  2:8,9; Gal. 2:16; Jn. 1:12) God freely offers salvation to all people, and our  salvation is secure.
<h4>Humanity</h4>
Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique among all  of God’s creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, we have turned  against God, and this has resulted in spiritual death for all humankind.  Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need which can only be  satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. Without this reconciliation,  all people stand under God’s righteous judgment. Humanity, although fallen,  maintains the image of God and is, therefore, still dignified and unique. God  continues to love us and initiate toward us, even though we are hostile to Him.  Believers in Jesus Christ receive a new nature that becomes the foundation for a  process of transformation. (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<h4>The Church</h4>
The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving faith in  Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but people. God wants all  Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate context. This  context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature of our witness for  Christ. The church is God’s chosen instrument through which the message of  salvation is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the  church. We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the  gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26;  Matthew 28:19)
<h4>Satan</h4>
Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God’s followers. Satan  actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality of Christians.  We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the reality of personal,  spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat and judgment when Christ  returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20)
<h4>The Afterlife</h4>
At the final judgment, God will determine those who will receive eternal life  and those who will live in eternal judgment. Therefore, there is an urgency to  the message of the gospel because eternal issues are at stake. (Matthew 25:46; 2  Thessalonians 1:5-10)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.
<div><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9853&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" /></div>
Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.
<div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111023410377579746"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Atl5C3OI/AAAAAAAABC0/v77f3ZI5on0/s400/DSC_1085.JPG" alt="" /></a></div>
Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9649&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></span></div>
Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9888&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></span></div>
Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.</td>

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9901&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></span></div>
Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9908&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></span></div>
Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9922&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></span></div>
Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7QxToZGBI/AAAAAAAAC0s/sHCQmFLi090/HPIM1383.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></span></div>
Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.
<div><span class="img"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7Q8ToZGPI/AAAAAAAAC2g/r7s1FHkxzRQ/HPIM1397.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></span></div>
Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.
<div><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111024411104960594"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Bn15C4FI/AAAAAAAABKM/Pi-fMgEedRg/s288/DSC_1202.JPG" alt="" /></a></div>
Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.</td>

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.</td>

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.

Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.

Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.</td>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.

Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.
Be sure to check out <a class="wiki" href="http://neonets.org/blog/joesnake/2007/09/17/baptismal/" target="_blank">Joe's Blog</a> about these baptisms...

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.</td>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.

Be sure to check out <a class="wiki" href="http://neonets.org/blog/joesnake/2007/09/17/baptismal/" target="_blank">Joe's Blog</a> about these baptisms...

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.

Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is the biblical purpose of baptism?</h3>
<img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/img/wiki_up/joe_baptism_med.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="237" align="right" />

Water baptism is a symbolic act through which believers publicly acknowledge their need for God’s forgiveness. Christian baptism, then, is not what causes you to become a Christian--it is something you do because you have become a Christian. It is not something you do to earn God’s acceptance--it is something you do because you have received the free gift of God’s acceptance through faith in Christ.
<h3>Why should you be baptized?</h3>
If you have personally received Christ, you are permanently forgiven and accepted by God whether you get baptized or not (Romans 8:1; Colossians 2:13,14).

There are many excellent reasons why you should be baptized.
<ol>
	<li>Jesus tells us to get baptized (see Matthew 28:19). It is a fitting and loving response of faith to get dunked!</li>
	<li>It is a powerful opportunity to stand up and tell people about the newness of life available through Jesus Christ. In this way many people have been spiritually influenced in a positive way, even receiving Jesus Christ themselvs. Non-Christian friends and family members usually attend our baptisms, and they are often deeply struck by the testimonies of those who get baptized.</li>
	<li>Your Christian friends and the entire Body of Christ is powerfully served by this and motivated to continue in sharing the message of Christ.</li>
	<li>Most important, it is an opportunity for you to take a step of faith and allow the Holy Spirit to work through you. To get baptized can be intimidating because it involves speaking to a group of people and taking a stand for your faith. It means stepping outside our "comfort zone" to do something that shares Christ and serves others. Yet the Holy Spirit who indwells us will empower us and lead us in supernatural ways we would never otherwise experience unless we took a chance with Him.</li>
</ol>
If you're involved in a home group, talk to a friend about what this could mean for you. If you're new to Xenos or not involved in a home group, but are interested in learning more about this incredible event, please call us. We'd love for you to experience a baptism event first hand!
<h3>What Do I Say at a Baptism?</h3>
One of the most helpful things a Christian can do is write out his personal testimony. This exercise will help you think through in your own mind what God has done in your life and will prepare you to share your story simply and clearly with others.
<ul>
	<li> Sharing how you became a Christian is one of the best ways of witnessing.</li>
	<li> It is particularly helpful in presenting Jesus Christ to relatives and close friends, usually the most difficult people to whom to witness.</li>
</ul>
In sharing the story of your experience:
<ul>
	<li> Make it personal — Don't preach.</li>
	<li> Tell what Christ has done for <em>you</em>.</li>
	<li> Make it short — Five minutes should be enough time to deal with the essential facts.</li>
	<li> Keep Christ central — Always highlight what He has done for you. Be sure to discuss <em>when</em> you <em>actually made the decision to receive</em> salvation.</li>
	<li> Use the Word of God! A verse or two of Scripture will add power to your story. Remember that the word of God has a keen cutting edge (Eph. 6:17).</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplebox">Please note: If your testimony includes a previous negative church experience, do not mention the name of that church or demonination because it creates needless antagonism in those who are listening to your story.</div>

<h4>Some Ideas</h4>
<ul>
	<li> Try writing down your personal testimony just the way you'd tell it to a non-Christian.</li>
	<li> Make the story of your conversion so clear that another person hearing it would know how to receive Christ.</li>
	<li> Tell a little about your life before you trusted Jesus Christ; then tell about your conversion, how you came to trust Him, and something of what it has meant to know Him — the blessing of sins forgiven, assurance of eternal life, and other ways your life or outlook has changed.</li>
	<li> If you have been a Christian for some time, be sure that your testimony includes some current information about the continuing effect of Jesus Christ in your life.</li>
</ul>
As you prepare your story, ask the Lord to give you opportunities to share it. Pray for two or three people whom you would particularly like to tell about Jesus Christ in your neighborhood, at work, or at school. Then take the first opportunity to share your testimony with them.

Follow a format similar to this:
<h4>MY TESTIMONY</h4>
<dl> <dt>Before I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>How I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>Since I've trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl>
<h4>The Bottom Line...</h4>
In conclusion, remember that you do not have the power in yourself to convince anyone of spiritual truth. The Holy Spirit convicts non-Christians of their need to know Christ (John 16:8). As you pray for those with whom you desire to share your personal testimony, be sure to ask God to honor the proclamation of His word, to convince people of their need, and to strengthen you as you share the gospel.

God has summoned each Christian to be a witness of what he has "seen and heard" (I John 1:3). Witnessing is a style of living — you are a witness at all times. Loving others and showing your genuine concern for them are practical ways to communicate the Love of Christ.

You also witness by your life. Actions are often more revealing than words. Your actions, however, are not sufficient to communicate to another the message of the gospel of Christ. You need to witness by your words — to identify openly with Jesus Christ and to tell others how they can be reconciled to God. One of the most effective means of communicating this to another person is the story of how God has worked in your life — your personal testimony.]]></content:encoded>

As you prepare your story, ask the Lord to give you opportunities to share it. Pray for two or three people whom you would particularly like to tell about Jesus Christ in your neighborhood, at work, or at school. Then take the first opportunity to share your testimony with them.

Follow a format similar to this:
<h4>MY TESTIMONY</h4>
<dl> <dt>Before I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>How I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>Since I've trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl>
<h4>The Bottom Line...</h4>
In conclusion, remember that you do not have the power in yourself to convince anyone of spiritual truth. The Holy Spirit convicts non-Christians of their need to know Christ (John 16:8). As you pray for those with whom you desire to share your personal testimony, be sure to ask God to honor the proclamation of His word, to convince people of their need, and to strengthen you as you share the gospel.

God has summoned each Christian to be a witness of what he has "seen and heard" (I John 1:3). Witnessing is a style of living — you are a witness at all times. Loving others and showing your genuine concern for them are practical ways to communicate the Love of Christ.

You also witness by your life. Actions are often more revealing than words. Your actions, however, are not sufficient to communicate to another the message of the gospel of Christ. You need to witness by your words — to identify openly with Jesus Christ and to tell others how they can be reconciled to God. One of the most effective means of communicating this to another person is the story of how God has worked in your life — your personal testimony.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is the biblical purpose of baptism?</h3>
<img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/img/wiki_up/joe_baptism_med.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="237" align="right" />

Water baptism is a symbolic act through which believers publicly acknowledge their need for God’s forgiveness. Christian baptism, then, is not what causes you to become a Christian--it is something you do because you have become a Christian. It is not something you do to earn God’s acceptance--it is something you do because you have received the free gift of God’s acceptance through faith in Christ.
<h3>Why should you be baptized?</h3>
If you have personally received Christ, you are permanently forgiven and accepted by God whether you get baptized or not (Romans 8:1; Colossians 2:13,14).

There are many excellent reasons why you should be baptized.
<ol>
	<li>Jesus tells us to get baptized (see Matthew 28:19). It is a fitting and loving response of faith to get dunked!</li>
	<li>It is a powerful opportunity to stand up and tell people about the newness of life available through Jesus Christ. In this way many people have been spiritually influenced in a positive way, even receiving Jesus Christ themselvs. Non-Christian friends and family members usually attend our baptisms, and they are often deeply struck by the testimonies of those who get baptized.</li>
	<li>Your Christian friends and the entire Body of Christ is powerfully served by this and motivated to continue in sharing the message of Christ.</li>
	<li>Most important, it is an opportunity for you to take a step of faith and allow the Holy Spirit to work through you. To get baptized can be intimidating because it involves speaking to a group of people and taking a stand for your faith. It means stepping outside our "comfort zone" to do something that shares Christ and serves others. Yet the Holy Spirit who indwells us will empower us and lead us in supernatural ways we would never otherwise experience unless we took a chance with Him.</li>
</ol>
If you're involved in a home group, talk to a friend about what this could mean for you. If you're new to Xenos or not involved in a home group, but are interested in learning more about this incredible event, please call us. We'd love for you to experience a baptism event first hand!
<h3>What Do I Say at a Baptism?</h3>
One of the most helpful things a Christian can do is write out his personal testimony. This exercise will help you think through in your own mind what God has done in your life and will prepare you to share your story simply and clearly with others.
<ul>
	<li> Sharing how you became a Christian is one of the best ways of witnessing.</li>
	<li> It is particularly helpful in presenting Jesus Christ to relatives and close friends, usually the most difficult people to whom to witness.</li>
</ul>
In sharing the story of your experience:
<ul>
	<li> Make it personal — Don't preach.</li>
	<li> Tell what Christ has done for <em>you</em>.</li>
	<li> Make it short — Five minutes should be enough time to deal with the essential facts.</li>
	<li> Keep Christ central — Always highlight what He has done for you. Be sure to discuss <em>when</em> you <em>actually made the decision to receive</em> salvation.</li>
	<li> Use the Word of God! A verse or two of Scripture will add power to your story. Remember that the word of God has a keen cutting edge (Eph. 6:17).</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplebox">Please note: If your testimony includes a previous negative church experience, do not mention the name of that church or demonination because it creates needless antagonism in those who are listening to your story.</div>

<ul>
	<li> Try writing down your personal testimony just the way you'd tell it to a non-Christian.</li>
	<li> Make the story of your conversion so clear that another person hearing it would know how to receive Christ.</li>
	<li> Tell a little about your life before you trusted Jesus Christ; then tell about your conversion, how you came to trust Him, and something of what it has meant to know Him — the blessing of sins forgiven, assurance of eternal life, and other ways your life or outlook has changed.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.

Be sure to check out <a class="wiki" href="http://neonets.org/blog/joesnake/2007/09/17/baptismal/" target="_blank">Joe's Blog</a> about these baptisms...
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9841&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9853&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" />
Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111023410377579746"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Atl5C3OI/AAAAAAAABC0/v77f3ZI5on0/s400/DSC_1085.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111023625125944706"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4A6F5C3YI/AAAAAAAABEE/CQ4mZky0J64/s288/DSC_1098.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9649&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9888&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9898&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9901&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9908&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9922&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7QxToZGBI/AAAAAAAAC0s/sHCQmFLi090/HPIM1383.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7Q8ToZGPI/AAAAAAAAC2g/r7s1FHkxzRQ/HPIM1397.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111024411104960594"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Bn15C4FI/AAAAAAAABKM/Pi-fMgEedRg/s288/DSC_1202.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.

Be sure to check out <a class="wiki" href="http://neonets.org/blog/joesnake/2007/09/17/baptismal/" target="_blank">Joe's Blog</a> about these baptisms...

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.

Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111023410377579746"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Atl5C3OI/AAAAAAAABC0/v77f3ZI5on0/s400/DSC_1085.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.

Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7QxToZGBI/AAAAAAAAC0s/sHCQmFLi090/HPIM1383.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7Q8ToZGPI/AAAAAAAAC2g/r7s1FHkxzRQ/HPIM1397.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111024411104960594"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Bn15C4FI/AAAAAAAABKM/Pi-fMgEedRg/s288/DSC_1202.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is the biblical purpose of baptism?</h3>
<img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/img/wiki_up/joe_baptism_med.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="237" align="right" />

Water baptism is a symbolic act through which believers publicly acknowledge their need for God’s forgiveness. Christian baptism, then, is not what causes you to become a Christian--it is something you do because you have become a Christian. It is not something you do to earn God’s acceptance--it is something you do because you have received the free gift of God’s acceptance through faith in Christ.
<h3>Why should you be baptized?</h3>
If you have personally received Christ, you are permanently forgiven and accepted by God whether you get baptized or not (Romans 8:1; Colossians 2:13,14).

There are many excellent reasons why you should be baptized.
<ol>
	<li>Jesus tells us to get baptized (see Matthew 28:19). It is a fitting and loving response of faith to get dunked!</li>
	<li>It is a powerful opportunity to stand up and tell people about the newness of life available through Jesus Christ. In this way many people have been spiritually influenced in a positive way, even receiving Jesus Christ themselvs. Non-Christian friends and family members usually attend our baptisms, and they are often deeply struck by the testimonies of those who get baptized.</li>
	<li>Your Christian friends and the entire Body of Christ is powerfully served by this and motivated to continue in sharing the message of Christ.</li>
	<li>Most important, it is an opportunity for you to take a step of faith and allow the Holy Spirit to work through you. To get baptized can be intimidating because it involves speaking to a group of people and taking a stand for your faith. It means stepping outside our "comfort zone" to do something that shares Christ and serves others. Yet the Holy Spirit who indwells us will empower us and lead us in supernatural ways we would never otherwise experience unless we took a chance with Him.</li>
</ol>
If you're involved in a home group, talk to a friend about what this could mean for you. If you're new to Xenos or not involved in a home group, but are interested in learning more about this incredible event, please call us. We'd love for you to experience a baptism event first hand!
<h3>What Do I Say at a Baptism?</h3>
One of the most helpful things a Christian can do is write out his personal testimony. This exercise will help you think through in your own mind what God has done in your life and will prepare you to share your story simply and clearly with others.
<ul>
	<li> Sharing how you became a Christian is one of the best ways of witnessing.</li>
	<li> It is particularly helpful in presenting Jesus Christ to relatives and close friends, usually the most difficult people to whom to witness.</li>
</ul>
In sharing the story of your experience:
<ul>
	<li> Make it personal — Don't preach.</li>
	<li> Tell what Christ has done for <em>you</em>.</li>
	<li> Make it short — Five minutes should be enough time to deal with the essential facts.</li>
	<li> Keep Christ central — Always highlight what He has done for you. Be sure to discuss <em>when</em> you <em>actually made the decision to receive</em> salvation.</li>
	<li> Use the Word of God! A verse or two of Scripture will add power to your story. Remember that the word of God has a keen cutting edge (Eph. 6:17).</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplebox">Please note: If your testimony includes a previous negative church experience, do not mention the name of that church or demonination because it creates needless antagonism in those who are listening to your story.</div>
<h4>TESTIMONY PITFALLS TO AVOID</h4>

</div>
<ol>
	<li> Not focusing on the Lord and what he's done in your life</li>
	<li> Bashing of prior church or denomination</li>
	<li> Giving the glory to Xenos and/or friends</li>
	<li> Verbosity</li>
	<li> Not being clear that you made a point-in-time decision to accept Christ</li>
</ol>
<h4>Some Ideas</h4>
<ul>
	<li> Try writing down your personal testimony just the way you'd tell it to a non-Christian.</li>
	<li> Make the story of your conversion so clear that another person hearing it would know how to receive Christ.</li>
	<li> Tell a little about your life before you trusted Jesus Christ; then tell about your conversion, how you came to trust Him, and something of what it has meant to know Him — the blessing of sins forgiven, assurance of eternal life, and other ways your life or outlook has changed.</li>
	<li> If you have been a Christian for some time, be sure that your testimony includes some current information about the continuing effect of Jesus Christ in your life.</li>
</ul>
As you prepare your story, ask the Lord to give you opportunities to share it. Pray for two or three people whom you would particularly like to tell about Jesus Christ in your neighborhood, at work, or at school. Then take the first opportunity to share your testimony with them.

Follow a format similar to this:
<h4>MY TESTIMONY</h4>
<dl> <dt>Before I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>How I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>Since I've trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl>
<h4>The Bottom Line...</h4>
In conclusion, remember that you do not have the power in yourself to convince anyone of spiritual truth. The Holy Spirit convicts non-Christians of their need to know Christ (John 16:8). As you pray for those with whom you desire to share your personal testimony, be sure to ask God to honor the proclamation of His word, to convince people of their need, and to strengthen you as you share the gospel.

God has summoned each Christian to be a witness of what he has "seen and heard" (I John 1:3). Witnessing is a style of living — you are a witness at all times. Loving others and showing your genuine concern for them are practical ways to communicate the Love of Christ.

You also witness by your life. Actions are often more revealing than words. Your actions, however, are not sufficient to communicate to another the message of the gospel of Christ. You need to witness by your words — to identify openly with Jesus Christ and to tell others how they can be reconciled to God. One of the most effective means of communicating this to another person is the story of how God has worked in your life — your personal testimony.]]></content:encoded>

You also witness by your life. Actions are often more revealing than words. Your actions, however, are not sufficient to communicate to another the message of the gospel of Christ.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is the biblical purpose of baptism?</h3>
<img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/img/wiki_up/joe_baptism_med.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="237" align="right" />

Water baptism is a symbolic act through which believers publicly acknowledge their need for God’s forgiveness. Christian baptism, then, is not what causes you to become a Christian--it is something you do because you have become a Christian. It is not something you do to earn God’s acceptance--it is something you do because you have received the free gift of God’s acceptance through faith in Christ.
<h3>Why should you be baptized?</h3>
If you have personally received Christ, you are permanently forgiven and accepted by God whether you get baptized or not (Romans 8:1; Colossians 2:13,14).

There are many excellent reasons why you should be baptized.
<ol>
	<li>Jesus tells us to get baptized (see Matthew 28:19). It is a fitting and loving response of faith to get dunked!</li>
	<li>It is a powerful opportunity to stand up and tell people about the newness of life available through Jesus Christ. In this way many people have been spiritually influenced in a positive way, even receiving Jesus Christ themselvs. Non-Christian friends and family members usually attend our baptisms, and they are often deeply struck by the testimonies of those who get baptized.</li>
	<li>Your Christian friends and the entire Body of Christ is powerfully served by this and motivated to continue in sharing the message of Christ.</li>
	<li>Most important, it is an opportunity for you to take a step of faith and allow the Holy Spirit to work through you. To get baptized can be intimidating because it involves speaking to a group of people and taking a stand for your faith. It means stepping outside our "comfort zone" to do something that shares Christ and serves others. Yet the Holy Spirit who indwells us will empower us and lead us in supernatural ways we would never otherwise experience unless we took a chance with Him.</li>
</ol>
If you're involved in a home group, talk to a friend about what this could mean for you. If you're new to Xenos or not involved in a home group, but are interested in learning more about this incredible event, please call us. We'd love for you to experience a baptism event first hand!
<h3>What Do I Say at a Baptism?</h3>
One of the most helpful things a Christian can do is write out his personal testimony. This exercise will help you think through in your own mind what God has done in your life and will prepare you to share your story simply and clearly with others.
<ul>
	<li> Sharing how you became a Christian is one of the best ways of witnessing.</li>
	<li> It is particularly helpful in presenting Jesus Christ to relatives and close friends, usually the most difficult people to whom to witness.</li>
</ul>
In sharing the story of your experience:
<ul>
	<li> Make it personal — Don't preach.</li>
	<li> Tell what Christ has done for <em>you</em>.</li>
	<li> Make it short — Five minutes should be enough time to deal with the essential facts.</li>
	<li> Keep Christ central — Always highlight what He has done for you. Be sure to discuss <em>when</em> you <em>actually made the decision to receive</em> salvation.</li>
	<li> Use the Word of God! A verse or two of Scripture will add power to your story. Remember that the word of God has a keen cutting edge (Eph. 6:17).</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplebox">Please note: If your testimony includes a previous negative church experience, do not mention the name of that church or demonination because it creates needless antagonism in those who are listening to your story.</div>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos Christian Fellowship is a non-traditional, interdenominational church with mainstream <a href="/about/beliefs" target="_self">biblical doctrines</a>.  In <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home groups</a> we develop   Christian communities <a href="/ministries/leadership" target="_self">led by volunteers</a>.
<p align="center"><img src="http://neoxenos.org/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What Makes Xenos Tick?</h3>
<strong> </strong>Like other Christian Evangelical churches,             we celebrate the Bible's message of freedom and the hope this brings to all humanity through Jesus Christ. We also dump the confusing rituals and traditions wherever the Bible gives us this freedom. Jesus taught about spiritual life and relationships, not <em>religion</em>.

This is why <a href="/ministries">our ministries</a> provide a warm and non-threatening environment             where people can seek God, ask questions, and find out what the Bible actually says. Read about <a href="/about/beliefs">our beliefs</a> to see what's so exciting about this person named Jesus Christ. He was remarkably irreligious, and he was all about personal relationships. Jesus brings a newness to life, called spiritual life, and that's when things get really interesting!

<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<strong> </strong>Xenos began as a home church movement <a href="http://xenos.org">in Columbus</a>,               Ohio where it swelled into a fellowship of about 3,800 adult members               in more than 60 home churches!           At that time, people from Cleveland began asking for the same kind             of informal meeting atmosphere.           In 1994 a Xenos church was first planted in Cleveland, and in 2001 the first Northeast Ohio Xenos church was planted at <a href="/meetings/cbs">Kent State University</a>. Since then we have planted more <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home churches</a> with a thriving <a href="/meetings/homegroups">Central Teaching</a> where everyone comes together in a larger meeting. We maintain a friendly and close           relationship             with <a href="/resources#xenos-links">other           Xenos churches</a> in Ohio. Read about our <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a>.
<h3>What Does the Word "Xenos" Mean?</h3>
<em>Xenos</em> (pronounced <em>zee-noss</em>) is a Greek word meaning             a traveler or someone living outside their native land. When combined             with the Greek word             <em>philo</em>, it             also means friendliness toward strangers, which describes how we open our homes to             others. The name Xenos reminds us that while we’re only temporary             residents on earth, we need to show true love and concern for all             people, especially those we don’t know yet. Xenos Christian             Fellowship welcomes people as they are.
<h3>What Does "NeoXenos" Mean?</h3>
If you lived anywhere near Cleveland you would already know that everything around here begins with "neo", as in "northeastern Ohio". That's because Cleveland is not just Cleveland. It's really a composite of three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland, Akron and Canton (sometimes Youngstown is included, but we prefer to ignore that). Northeast Ohio is a huge "Metropolitan Statistical Area" (MSA) according to the Census Bureau, and we're all over that MSA!

<title>Baptisms at Xenos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is the biblical purpose of baptism?</h3>
<img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/img/wiki_up/joe_baptism_med.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="237" align="right" />

Water baptism is a symbolic act through which believers publicly acknowledge their need for God’s forgiveness. Christian baptism, then, is not what causes you to become a Christian--it is something you do because you have become a Christian. It is not something you do to earn God’s acceptance--it is something you do because you have received the free gift of God’s acceptance through faith in Christ.
<h3>Why should you be baptized?</h3>
If you have personally received Christ, you are permanently forgiven and accepted by God whether you get baptized or not (Romans 8:1; Colossians 2:13,14).

There are many excellent reasons why you should be baptized.
<ol>
	<li>Jesus tells us to get baptized (see Matthew 28:19). It is a fitting and loving response of faith to get dunked!</li>
	<li>It is a powerful opportunity to stand up and tell people about the newness of life available through Jesus Christ. In this way many people have been spiritually influenced in a positive way, even receiving Jesus Christ themselvs. Non-Christian friends and family members usually attend our baptisms, and they are often deeply struck by the testimonies of those who get baptized.</li>
	<li>Your Christian friends and the entire Body of Christ is powerfully served by this and motivated to continue in sharing the message of Christ.</li>
	<li>Most important, it is an opportunity for you to take a step of faith and allow the Holy Spirit to work through you. To get baptized can be intimidating because it involves speaking to a group of people and taking a stand for your faith. It means stepping outside our "comfort zone" to do something that shares Christ and serves others. Yet the Holy Spirit who indwells us will empower us and lead us in supernatural ways we would never otherwise experience unless we took a chance with Him.</li>
</ol>
If you're involved in a home group, talk to a friend about what this could mean for you. If you're new to Xenos or not involved in a home group, but are interested in learning more about this incredible event, please call us. We'd love for you to experience a baptism event first hand!
<h3>What Do I Say at a Baptism?</h3>
One of the most helpful things a Christian can do is write out his personal testimony. This exercise will help you think through in your own mind what God has done in your life and will prepare you to share your story simply and clearly with others.
<ul>
	<li> Sharing how you became a Christian is one of the best ways of witnessing.</li>
	<li> It is particularly helpful in presenting Jesus Christ to relatives and close friends, usually the most difficult people to whom to witness.</li>
</ul>
In sharing the story of your experience:
<ul>
	<li> Make it personal — Don't preach.</li>
	<li> Tell what Christ has done for <em>you</em>.</li>
	<li> Make it short — Five minutes should be enough time to deal with the essential facts.</li>
	<li> Keep Christ central — Always highlight what He has done for you. Be sure to discuss <em>when</em> you <em>actually made the decision to receive</em> salvation.</li>
	<li> Use the Word of God! A verse or two of Scripture will add power to your story. Remember that the word of God has a keen cutting edge (Eph. 6:17).</li>
</ul>
<div class="simplebox">Please note: If your testimony includes a previous negative church experience, do not mention the name of that church or demonination because it creates needless antagonism in those who are listening to your story.</div>
<h4>TESTIMONY PITFALLS TO AVOID</h4>
<div class="cbox">
<div class="cbox-data"><span class="img"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/show_image.php?id=172" border="0" alt="" width="100" height="115" /></span></div>
</div>
<ol>
	<li> Not focusing on the Lord and what he's done in your life</li>
	<li> Bashing of prior church or denomination</li>
	<li> Giving the glory to Xenos and/or friends</li>
	<li> Verbosity</li>
	<li> Not being clear that you made a point-in-time decision to accept Christ</li>
</ol>
<h4>Some Ideas</h4>
<ul>
	<li> Try writing down your personal testimony just the way you'd tell it to a non-Christian.</li>
	<li> Make the story of your conversion so clear that another person hearing it would know how to receive Christ.</li>
	<li> Tell a little about your life before you trusted Jesus Christ; then tell about your conversion, how you came to trust Him, and something of what it has meant to know Him — the blessing of sins forgiven, assurance of eternal life, and other ways your life or outlook has changed.</li>
	<li> If you have been a Christian for some time, be sure that your testimony includes some current information about the continuing effect of Jesus Christ in your life.</li>
</ul>
As you prepare your story, ask the Lord to give you opportunities to share it. Pray for two or three people whom you would particularly like to tell about Jesus Christ in your neighborhood, at work, or at school. Then take the first opportunity to share your testimony with them.

Follow a format similar to this:
<h4>MY TESTIMONY</h4>
<dl> <dt>Before I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>How I trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl> <dl> <dt>Since I've trusted Christ</dt> <dd> ...</dd> </dl>
<h4>The Bottom Line...</h4>
In conclusion, remember that you do not have the power in yourself to convince anyone of spiritual truth. The Holy Spirit convicts non-Christians of their need to know Christ (John 16:8). As you pray for those with whom you desire to share your personal testimony, be sure to ask God to honor the proclamation of His word, to convince people of their need, and to strengthen you as you share the gospel.

God has summoned each Christian to be a witness of what he has "seen and heard" (I John 1:3). Witnessing is a style of living — you are a witness at all times. Loving others and showing your genuine concern for them are practical ways to communicate the Love of Christ.

You also witness by your life. Actions are often more revealing than words. Your actions, however, are not sufficient to communicate to another the message of the gospel of Christ. You need to witness by your words — to identify openly with Jesus Christ and to tell others how they can be reconciled to God. One of the most effective means of communicating this to another person is the story of how God has worked in your life — your personal testimony.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.

Be sure to check out <a class="wiki" href="http://neonets.org/blog/joesnake/2007/09/17/baptismal/" target="_blank">Joe's Blog</a> about these baptisms...
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9841&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9853&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" />
Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111023410377579746"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Atl5C3OI/AAAAAAAABC0/v77f3ZI5on0/s400/DSC_1085.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9888&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9898&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9901&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9908&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=9922&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" border="0" alt="" /></p>

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7QxToZGBI/AAAAAAAAC0s/sHCQmFLi090/HPIM1383.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.]]></content:encoded>

We like to think of it as an "underground church-planting movement" because it's not about institutions -- it's about people. Our group is led by college-age for college-age.

We know the Bible is at a crossroads with an educated and thinking culture. So we check it out. We want evidence for faith, not old superstitions, and relevancy, not traditions. Jesus in the Bible is profoundly counter-cultural, and he defies the popular ethos. Jesus builds life, not institutions.

We're pretty loose and easy to get to know. Right now we're launching the Crossroads Project. Read about it at our <a href="http://thecbs.org">CBS Web</a>

Newly-licensed teenage drivers and more seasoned ones are pouring into the spacious parking lot at 1407 Fairchild Avenue…but everyone — especially teenagers — are committed to exercising courteous behavior as guests of Riverwood Community Chapel (one of the many plants from "The Chapel" of Akron).

<em>The place is called <a href="http://www.riverwoodcommunitychapel.org/">Riverwood  Community Chapel</a>, one of several churches planted by <a href="http://www.the-chapel.org/">the  Chapel of Akron.</a> The group originally met at Kent Roosevelt High School until moving into their current facilities on the border of Stow and Kent.

Students make the best leaders for student groups if they receive support from adults zealous for life and spiritual growth.<em> These Bible studies kick out tha jams!</em>

These groups are so dynamic and exciting especially because students meet Christ and discover a whole new dimension to life.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What is <em>the Crossroads?</em></h3>
<p align="center"><img style="margin-right: 10px" src="http://kmccallum.net/joomla/images/stories/welcome/blackwolf1.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" width="270" height="183" align="left" /></p>

We like to think of it as an "underground church-planting movement", because it's not about institutions -- it's about people. Our group is led by college-age for college-age.

We know the Bible is at a crossroads with an educated and thinking culture. So we check it out. We <em>talk.</em> We want evidence for faith, not old superstitions. Let’s stick with what matters, not traditions.

When you read about the Jesus in the Bible, he’s profoundly counter-cultural. Jesus builds life, not institutions. He defied the religious assumptions. That’s why they killed him.

Read about us at our <a href="http://thecbs.org">CBS Web</a>. We're pretty loose, easy to meet, fun. That's right. And we're launching the new <a href="http://thecbs.org/theproject">Crossroads Project</a> right now.<a href="http://thecbs.org"></a>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

Family and friends in the audience heard about the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. One woman made the decision to receive Christ then and there. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.

Many who were baptized described how God has helped them learn to love others and build deep relationships in the Body of Christ. They also shared character issues He’s transformed in them from the inside out. Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.

Angie was in the midst of a crumbling marriage and financial stress when she finally realized she couldn’t make her life work by herself. Abandoning her pride, she prayed for God’s help and forgiveness.

Brian, or B.K., came to high school Word events for two years before realizing the importance of salvation. After acknowledging his need for eternal life, he prayed to receive Christ.

Yana was lonely and depressed after moving to the U.S. from Russia. She turned to drinking in high school, and then school and career goals in college, before realizing that we are saved “by grace through faith, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast” (Eph. 2:8,9).

Becky grew up in a church but learned more about God after coming to Word. After investigating these claims more, she made the choice to act on what she believed by asking God for a relationship.

Anele grew up in Xenos, but never understood her need to have a personal relationship with God until she acknowledged the lack of meaning in her life apart from Him. She prayed with her mom to receive Christ when she was twelve and has been maturing ever since.

Marilynn was a skeptical agnostic until she started coming to Bible studies, when she realized that there was evidence for Christianity. After acknowledging her demanding attitude toward God, she humbled herself to start a relationship with God on His terms.

John had many objections to Christianity, but slowly got his questions answered through teachings and conversations at Word. He prayed to receive Christ at last year’s all-night prayer meeting.

Cloe was lonely, scared, and confused until a friend invited her to Word and she learned about God’s love and grace. Her decision to accept Him has “melted her from the inside out” and motivated her to share His love with others.

Shelley was baptized after receiving Christ just the night before. She glowed with the enthusiasm of a brand-new Christian who now understands the power of Christ’s death and resurrection.

Josh never felt accepted until he met a fellow “nerd” who invited him to Word. For a long time he struggled with declaring “Jesus is Lord” (Romans 10:9), but felt the excitement of salvation after he decided to proclaim this.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7QxToZGBI/AAAAAAAAC0s/sHCQmFLi090/HPIM1383.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Antonio came to the U.S. from Mexico to get a Ph.D. After being invited to the college Bible study and learning that “we are saved by grace, not works,” he will be leaving with eternal life as well.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/jsmalley007/Ru7Q8ToZGPI/AAAAAAAAC2g/r7s1FHkxzRQ/HPIM1397.jpg?imgmax=512" border="0" alt="" width="300" /></p>

Tina was angry and frustrated before praying to receive Christ at age fifteen. God has helped her forgive the people she was angry with, restore those relationships, and have peace in her life.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mccallumk/Baptisms2007/photo#5111024411104960594"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/mccallumk/Ru4Bn15C4FI/AAAAAAAABKM/Pi-fMgEedRg/s288/DSC_1202.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

Dan learned about God's love at the college Bible study, but moved away before accepting Christ. At that same time that he was suffering from extreme loneliness, a friend from Bible study had a new burden to share the gospel with him. Since praying for salvation, Dan moved back to Ohio and got involved in the Bible study again.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun shone brightly for the 2007 <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org/">NeoXenos</a> baptisms, which saw fourteen people get dunked at Walton Hills Lake Club. The September 16th event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual significance of baptism, the real excitement began. Each of the fourteen shared their testimony, and then got baptized by the people who played a significant role in their decision to accept Christ.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those engaged in discipleship or parenting, the new collection of articles about "Millennials" and the "Generation X" phenomena may prove helpful. The series highlights the target of Christian maturity in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, but then digs into the modern social phenomenon hindering maturity (in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/raising-infantiles/" target="_blank">Raising Infantiles</a>). A biblical framework for Christian parenting is then established in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/reality-parenting/" target="_blank">Reality Parenting</a>. All these principles apply to discipleship.

We now have new material available from Katey Downs and the <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics class</a> thanks to Darlene McCallum, Lisa Beech, Kalie Brooks, Kathryn Hughes, Diana Michalek and others an meeting on Fridays at Kathryn's house .

Katey Downs is also a contributing editor at the <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> (see <a class="wiki" href="http://downs.neozine.org%29/" target="_blank">http://neozine.org/downs)</a>.  As Director of Counseling at Columbus Xenos, Katey brings decades of experience to NeoXenos and the rest of the Web. Katey's counseling is captured in much of our <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics material</a> and was successful with some of the toughest emotional issues.

In related developments:
<ul>
	<li> <strong>We opened a forum for discussing parenting and counseling issues with Katey!</strong></li>
	<li> <strong>Dr. Ankenman has kindly offered to host a seminar for Northeast Ohio Xenos</strong> on disciplining with "Love Authority".</li>
	<li> <strong>A new <a class="wiki" href="http://ethics.neozine.org/" target="_blank">"Love Ethics" section</a> in the NeoZine</strong><a class="wiki wikinew" title="NeoZine&lt;/b&gt;" href="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/tiki-editpage.php?page=NeoZine%3Cb%3E">?</a> is under construction, which will act as a repository of parenting, counseling, and other materials from our classes and research.</li>
</ul>
This week Keith McCallum drove to Cedarville with Katey Downs to spent another day with Dr. Ankenman discussing Love Ethics and reviewing some of the recent <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> posts. He enjoyed the "Punks / Sissies / Bullies / Tramps" paradigm discussed in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, and pointed out that Bullies would be called "Sociopaths" and Tramps would be "Borderline Personalities" in psychiatric terms (in their extremely dysfunctional states).

The additional hours of Ankenman interviews will soon appear in <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> in the Love Ethics section.]]></content:encoded>

He enjoyed the "Punks / Sissies / Bullies / Tramps" paradigm discussed in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, and pointed out that Bullies would be called "Sociopaths" and Tramps would be "Borderline Personalities" in psychiatric terms (in their extremely dysfunctional states).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those engaged in discipleship or parenting, the new collection of articles about "Millennials" and the "Generation X" phenomena may prove helpful. The series highlights the target of Christian maturity in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, but then digs into the modern social phenomenon hindering maturity (in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/raising-infantiles/" target="_blank">Raising Infantiles</a>). A biblical framework for Christian parenting is then established in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/reality-parenting/" target="_blank">Reality Parenting</a>. All these principles apply to discipleship.

We now have new material available from Katey Downs and the <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics class</a> thanks to Darlene McCallum, Lisa Beech, Kalie Brooks, Kathryn Hughes, Diana Michalek and others an meeting on Fridays at Kathryn's house. They call their working group "The Love Squad".

Katey Downs is also a contributing editor at the <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> (see <a class="wiki" href="http://downs.neozine.org%29/" target="_blank">http://neozine.org/downs)</a>.  As Director of Counseling at Columbus Xenos, Katey brings decades of experience to NeoXenos and the rest of the Web. Katey's counseling is captured in much of our <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics material</a> and was successful with some of the toughest emotional issues.

In related developments:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">“Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit…” (Matthew 28:18). Christ’s Great Commission includes the call to baptize believers, so NeoXenos gathered on September 7<sup>th</sup> at the Walton Hills Lake Club to witness ten people get dunked for Jesus. The event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual symbol of baptism, the real excitement began. Each “baptizee” shared his or her testimony and then was baptized by one or two people who played a role in their decision to follow Christ.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Lisa Kostyak grew up in church but never understood the personal decision needed to know Christ. After coming to Bible studies for over a year, she attended the 2007 baptisms where the testimonies moved her to accept Jesus right away. She said asking for God’s forgiveness was “the easiest thing I’ve done in my life” and explained the overwhelming weight of guilt that was lifted afterward.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Elli Morscher grew up in a Christian home in Xenos, but never knew why she went to Bible studies. Jesus certainly wasn’t in her life, as she was a bossy, selfish liar. But 6<sup>th</sup> grade Blowout camp caused her to consider handing her life over to God. She was anxious, but decided to ask God into her heart, and now God is teaching her how to love and giving her “something to live for.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Lauren Dakters was depressed, anti-social, and self-destructive before she knew Christ. Then she was invited to a high school Bible study and learned about God’s forgiveness, which she decided to ask for some time later. She said now “there’s more to life than playing emo songs on guitar,” and she is a happier and more loving person.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Danielle Fazzio grew up Catholic, but she wasn’t interested in God. Her friendships never lasted and she ended up in an abusive relationship. When her friend invited her to a college Bible study, she made fun of her, but eventually she gave it a try. There she admired the relationships and love in the Body of Christ, which caused her to consider the gospel’s claims. Since she became a believer, Christ has helped her to impact her friends in new ways.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Mike Hudock was a lonely gamer when friends started inviting him to the high school Bible study. Despite his refusals, he was surprised they didn’t give up. When he finally started coming, one of the leaders didn’t give up on witnessing to him, either. Finally Ephesians 2:8, 9 convinced him that couldn’t earn his way into heaven. He prayed to receive Christ and since then he gained confidence, became less selfish, and wants to tell people about grace.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Paul Song was raised in a Christian family but he viewed God academically. He was lonely, unemotional, and trying to earn his way to heaven by good works. For a long time he avoided the questions raised at the high school Bible study, but was surprised people still accepted him. Four years later a friend explained the story of Nicodemus in John 3 and he realized it was his pride, not a lack of information, which prevented him from accepting salvation. This occurred just one day before the baptisms!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Tom Smith didn’t know how to interact with people besides using them. He thought needing forgiveness was pathetic, but Christians’ persistent love for him changed his mind over a period of five years. One man challenged him to ask for salvation and finally his tough shell started to soften. Now he can’t imagine where he’d be if he hadn’t accepted God’s forgiveness.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Shelby Roszkowski was the “cliché” girl in middle school, interested in superficial appearances, gossip, and boys. But as the void in her life began to gnaw, she turned to drugs, dating, using people, and a suicide attempt to numb the pain. Her church background reminded her that Jesus died on the cross to pay for sin. So one day she read Isaiah 40:6, a verse about crying out to God. And she did just that, asking Him to forgive her. She realizes God filled a void she could never fill by herself.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Jordan Yoerger grew up in Xenos with Christian parents, but never really believed what he learned about God. He was a jerk and fought with his parents and brother every day. He also argued relentlessly with one of the high school Bible study leaders, who nevertheless told him, “I will never give up on you.” This melted his hard exterior and that night he prayed for God to come into his life. His new faith has motivated him spiritually in a whole new way.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Ephesians 2:8, 9 sounded as a refrain throughout many of the testimonies: “It is by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.” How freeing God’s gift is when we realize our sin has been paid for in full! Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">Family and friends in the audience heard the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. Two people made the decision to receive Christ during conversations after the baptisms. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.</span></span></p>

After coming to Bible studies for over a year, she attended the 2007 baptisms where the testimonies moved her to accept Jesus right away. She said asking for God’s forgiveness was “the easiest thing I’ve done in my life” and explained the overwhelming weight of guilt that was lifted afterward.</span></span></p>

Jesus certainly wasn’t in her life, as she was a bossy, selfish liar. But 6<sup>th</sup> grade Blowout camp caused her to consider handing her life over to God. She was anxious, but decided to ask God into her heart, and now God is teaching her how to love and giving her “something to live for.”</span></span></p>

Then she was invited to a high school Bible study and learned about God’s forgiveness, which she decided to ask for some time later. She said now “there’s more to life than playing emo songs on guitar,” and she is a happier and more loving person.</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150" caption="Kids are different today - read Joe&#39;s blog about murder in MySpace"]<a href="http://joesnake.neoblogs.org/2008/03/25/little-tyrants/"><img src="http://neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=12161&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="nuns save kids" width="150" height="150" /></a>[/caption]

For those engaged in discipleship or parenting, the new collection of articles about "Millennials" and the "Generation X" phenomena may prove helpful. The series highlights the target of Christian maturity in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, but then digs into the modern social phenomenon hindering maturity (in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/raising-infantiles/" target="_blank">Raising Infantiles</a>). A biblical framework for Christian parenting is then established in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/reality-parenting/" target="_blank">Reality Parenting</a>. All these principles apply to discipleship.

We now have new material available from Katey Downs and the <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics class</a> thanks to Darlene McCallum, Lisa Beech, Kalie Brooks, Kathryn Hughes, Diana Michalek and others an meeting on Fridays at Kathryn's house. They call their working group "The Love Squad".

Katey Downs is now a contributing editor at the <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> (see <a class="wiki" href="http://downs.neozine.org%29/" target="_blank">http://neozine.org/downs)</a>.  As Director of Counseling at Columbus Xenos, Katey brings decades of experience to NeoXenos and the rest of the Web. Katey's counseling is captured in much of our <a href="http://neozine.org/ethics">Love Ethics material</a> and was successful with some of the toughest emotional issues.

In related developments:
<ul>
	<li> <strong>We opened a forum for discussing parenting and counseling issues with Katey!</strong></li>
	<li> <strong>Dr. Ankenman has kindly offered to host a seminar for Northeast Ohio Xenos</strong> on disciplining with "Love Authority".</li>
	<li> <strong>A new <a class="wiki" href="http://ethics.neozine.org/" target="_blank">"Love Ethics" section</a> in the NeoZine</strong><a class="wiki wikinew" title="NeoZine&lt;/b&gt;" href="http://neoxenos.net/tiki/tiki-editpage.php?page=NeoZine%3Cb%3E">?</a> is under construction, which will act as a repository of parenting, counseling, and other materials from our classes and research.</li>
</ul>
This week Keith McCallum drove to Cedarville with Katey Downs to spent another day with Dr. Ankenman discussing Love Ethics and reviewing some of the recent <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> posts. He enjoyed the "Punks / Sissies / Bullies / Tramps" paradigm discussed in <a class="wiki" href="http://neozine.org/inside/2008/time-to-grow-up/" target="_blank">Time to Grow Up!</a>, and pointed out that Bullies would be called "Sociopaths" and Tramps would be "Borderline Personalities" in psychiatric terms (in their extremely dysfunctional states).

The additional hours of Ankenman interviews will soon appear in <a class="wiki" href="http://neoxenos.net/zine">NeoZine</a> in the Love Ethics section.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA["Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit..." (Matthew 28:18).

Christ's Great Commission includes the call to baptize believers, so NeoXenos gathered on September 7<sup>th</sup> at the Walton Hills Lake Club to witness ten people get dunked for Jesus. The event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual symbol of baptism, the real excitement began. Each "baptizee" shared his or her testimony and then was baptized by one or two people who played a role in their decision to follow Christ.

"It was the best of times, <em>period!</em>" So should begin any recap of 2007 for <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org">NeoXenos</a> (with apologies to Charles Dickens).

Why so upbeat? The past year triggered significant growth in all our ministry groups, despite considerable hurdles. More intriguing is what to expect from new frontiers opened in 2007, such as the Service Ministry, Missions, Discovery Groups, and classes for ministry-equipping. Even more frontiers will open up this year--including another college ministry with a new Akron-based ministry house--which could make 2008 yet another record-breaking year.

With all this growth in new and existing ministries, 2007 was a remarkable break from past years which often stretched scarce leadership resources to the limit. But an unexpected number of new ministers emerged to share the burden and make expansion possible. Veteran leaders were greatly relieved.

All this and more were part of a long weekend of revelations discovered at the 2008 annual SLUM retreat.

The Sphere Leaders' Undershepherd Ministry (SLUM) gathered at Punderson State Park last weekend to prepare for the upcoming Fiscal Support Team (FST) retreat. The SLUM consists of the elders, trustees and their spouses charged with oversight of Xenos finances and activities. Currently the Board of Trustees consists of Joel Hughes, Keith McCallum<a class="wiki wikinew" title="McCallum" href="tiki-editpage.php?page=McCallum">?</a>, Mark Michalek and Greg Morscher, bringing together representatives from all ministry spheres.

Keith opened with observations about the significant change underway in the fellowship. Since Xenos was first planted in this area, 2007 was unique as the first time a large pool of competent and unified leaders emerged, enabling ministry efforts never before possible. A welcome side-effect was the prevalence of loving relationships in all the ministry groups, he said, "which means we're in a position of strength Paul described in Philippians 2."

The passage reads, "If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves." (Philippians 2:1-3 NIV)

This "one in spirit" is remarkable, but Xenos still faces a glaring hurdle, Keith said. Citing John Wesley's efforts in the 1700s, the glaring difference with modern Christianity is the large numbers of "Itinerants," as they were known. These were the people whose courage and Christian evangelism changed England and led the world in bringing God's mercy and love to the common masses. They transformed inhumane "Work House" prisons, built the first humane orphanages and public hospitals for the poor and sick. They abolished the cruel slave trade, and as they spread into America they led the "Radical Abolitionists" who eventually killed slavery here.

They were called the <em>Methodists</em> because they were highly methodical in the way they grew. Xenos imitates their key strategies by meeting in Cell Groups, Home Churches and Central Teachings. These groups seem usual today, but not in Wesley's lifetime. As a result, when Wesley died more than 100,000 Methodists sprawled across England and another 50,000 were penetrating America. All this rested on the backs of the <em>Itinerants</em> who led the movement.

The expanding frontiers in this fellowship not only requires a significant leadership population, but leaders with spiritual stature like the <em>Itinerants.</em> This research and the biblical issues it raises will be presented in more detail at the FST retreat.

The abundance of fruitfulness and God's activity surveyed at the SLUM retreat left the participants exhilarated but thoroughly exhausted. Stay tuned to the Neo News front page as more details emerge.]]></content:encoded>

Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves." (Philippians 2:1-3 NIV)

This "one in spirit" is remarkable, but Xenos still faces a glaring hurdle, Keith said. Citing John Wesley's efforts in the 1700s, the glaring difference with modern Christianity is the large numbers of "Itinerants," as they were known. These were the people whose courage and Christian evangelism changed England and led the world in bringing God's mercy and love to the common masses. They transformed inhumane "Work House" prisons, built the first humane orphanages and public hospitals for the poor and sick. They abolished the cruel slave trade, and as they spread into America they led the "Radical Abolitionists" who eventually killed slavery here.

They were called the <em>Methodists</em> because they were highly methodical in the way they grew. Xenos imitates their key strategies by meeting in Cell Groups, Home Churches and Central Teachings. These groups seem usual today, but not in Wesley's lifetime. As a result, when Wesley died more than 100,000 Methodists sprawled across England and another 50,000 were penetrating America. All this rested on the backs of the <em>Itinerants</em> who led the movement.

The expanding frontiers in this fellowship not only requires a significant leadership population, but leaders with spiritual stature like the <em>Itinerants.</em> This research and the biblical issues it raises will be presented in more detail at the FST retreat.

The abundance of fruitfulness and God's activity surveyed at the SLUM retreat left the participants exhilarated but thoroughly exhausted. Stay tuned to the Neo News front page as more details emerge.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignright" width="215" caption="a wild &amp; wooly ride, but very much worthwhile!"]<img style="border: 0pt none" src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/growth.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="215" height="147" />[/caption]

"It was the best of times, <em>period!</em>" So should begin any recap of 2007 for <a class="wiki" href="http://www.neoxenos.org">NeoXenos</a> (with apologies to Charles Dickens).

Why so upbeat? The past year triggered significant growth in all our ministry groups, despite considerable hurdles. More intriguing is what to expect from new frontiers opened in 2007, such as the Service Ministry, Missions, Discovery Groups, and classes for ministry-equipping. Even more frontiers will open up this year--including another college ministry with a new Akron-based ministry house--which could make 2008 yet another record-breaking year.

With all this growth in new and existing ministries, 2007 was a remarkable break from past years which often stretched scarce leadership resources to the limit. But an unexpected number of new ministers emerged to share the burden and make expansion possible. Veteran leaders were greatly relieved.

All this and more were part of a long weekend of revelations discovered at the 2008 annual SLUM retreat.

The Sphere Leaders' Undershepherd Ministry (SLUM) gathered at Punderson State Park last weekend to prepare for the upcoming Fiscal Support Team (FST) retreat. The SLUM consists of the elders, trustees and their spouses charged with oversight of Xenos finances and activities. Currently the Board of Trustees consists of Joel Hughes, Keith McCallum<a class="wiki wikinew" title="McCallum" href="tiki-editpage.php?page=McCallum">?</a>, Mark Michalek and Greg Morscher, bringing together representatives from all ministry spheres.

Keith opened with observations about the significant change underway in the fellowship. Since Xenos was first planted in this area, 2007 was unique as the first time a large pool of competent and unified leaders emerged, enabling ministry efforts never before possible. A welcome side-effect was the prevalence of loving relationships in all the ministry groups, he said, "which means we're in a position of strength Paul described in Philippians 2."

The passage reads, "If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves." (Philippians 2:1-3 NIV)

This "one in spirit" is remarkable, but Xenos still faces a glaring hurdle, Keith said. Citing John Wesley's efforts in the 1700s, the glaring difference with modern Christianity is the large numbers of "Itinerants," as they were known. These were the people whose courage and Christian evangelism changed England and led the world in bringing God's mercy and love to the common masses. They transformed inhumane "Work House" prisons, built the first humane orphanages and public hospitals for the poor and sick. They abolished the cruel slave trade, and as they spread into America they led the "Radical Abolitionists" who eventually killed slavery here.

They were called the <em>Methodists</em> because they were highly methodical in the way they grew. Xenos imitates their key strategies by meeting in Cell Groups, Home Churches and Central Teachings. These groups seem usual today, but not in Wesley's lifetime. As a result, when Wesley died more than 100,000 Methodists sprawled across England and another 50,000 were penetrating America. All this rested on the backs of the <em>Itinerants</em> who led the movement.

The expanding frontiers in this fellowship not only requires a significant leadership population, but leaders with spiritual stature like the <em>Itinerants.</em> This research and the biblical issues it raises will be presented in more detail at the FST retreat.

The abundance of fruitfulness and God's activity surveyed at the SLUM retreat left the participants exhilarated but thoroughly exhausted. Stay tuned to the Neo News front page as more details emerge.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"Go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit..." (Matthew 28:18).</blockquote>
Christ's Great Commission includes the call to baptize believers, so NeoXenos gathered on September 7<sup>th</sup> at the Walton Hills Lake Club to witness ten people get dunked for Jesus. The event began with a potluck, followed by a short teaching by Greg Morscher. After he explained the biblical basis and spiritual symbol of baptism, the real excitement began. Each "baptizee" shared his or her testimony and then was baptized by one or two people who played a role in their decision to follow Christ.

Lisa Kostyak grew up in church but never understood the personal decision needed to know Christ. After coming to Bible studies for over a year, she attended the 2007 baptisms where the testimonies moved her to accept Jesus right away. She said asking for God's forgiveness was "the easiest thing I've done in my life" and explained the overwhelming weight of guilt that was lifted afterward.

Elli Morscher grew up in a Christian home in Xenos, but never knew why she went to Bible studies. Jesus certainly wasn't in her life, as she was a bossy, selfish liar. But 6<sup>th</sup> grade Blowout camp caused her to consider handing her life over to God. She was anxious, but decided to ask God into her heart, and now God is teaching her how to love and giving her "something to live for."
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Lauren Dakters was depressed, anti-social, and self-destructive before she knew Christ. Then she was invited to a high school Bible study and learned about God's forgiveness, which she decided to ask for some time later. She said now "there's more to life than playing emo songs on guitar," and she is a happier and more loving person.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Danielle Fazzio grew up Catholic, but she wasn't interested in God. Her friendships never lasted and she ended up in an abusive relationship. When her friend invited her to a college Bible study, she made fun of her, but eventually she gave it a try. There she admired the relationships and love in the Body of Christ, which caused her to consider the gospel's claims. Since she became a believer, Christ has helped her to impact her friends in new ways.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Mike Hudock was a lonely gamer when friends started inviting him to the high school Bible study. Despite his refusals, he was surprised they didn't give up. When he finally started coming, one of the leaders didn't give up on witnessing to him, either. Finally Ephesians 2:8, 9 convinced him that couldn't earn his way into heaven. He prayed to receive Christ and since then he gained confidence, became less selfish, and wants to tell people about grace.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Paul Song was raised in a Christian family but he viewed God academically. He was lonely, unemotional, and trying to earn his way to heaven by good works. For a long time he avoided the questions raised at the high school Bible study, but was surprised people still accepted him. Four years later a friend explained the story of Nicodemus in John 3 and he realized it was his pride, not a lack of information, which prevented him from accepting salvation. This occurred just one day before the baptisms!</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Tom Smith didn't know how to interact with people besides using them. He thought needing forgiveness was pathetic, but Christians' persistent love for him changed his mind over a period of five years. One man challenged him to ask for salvation and finally his tough shell started to soften. Now he can't imagine where he'd be if he hadn't accepted God's forgiveness.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Shelby Roszkowski was the "cliché" girl in middle school, interested in superficial appearances, gossip, and boys. But as the void in her life began to gnaw, she turned to drugs, dating, using people, and a suicide attempt to numb the pain. Her church background reminded her that Jesus died on the cross to pay for sin. So one day she read Isaiah 40:6, a verse about crying out to God. And she did just that, asking Him to forgive her. She realizes God filled a void she could never fill by herself.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Jordan Yoerger grew up in Xenos with Christian parents, but never really believed what he learned about God. He was a jerk and fought with his parents and brother every day. He also argued relentlessly with one of the high school Bible study leaders, who nevertheless told him, "I will never give up on you." This melted his hard exterior and that night he prayed for God to come into his life. His new faith has motivated him spiritually in a whole new way.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Ephesians 2:8, 9 sounded as a refrain throughout many of the testimonies: "It is by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast." How freeing God's gift is when we realize our sin has been paid for in full! Throughout the testimonies, the goodness of God and His amazing grace shone through, as bright as the sun that warmed the celebration.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Family and friends in the audience heard the gospel repeatedly, as well as the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. Two people made the decision to receive Christ during conversations after the baptisms. Pray that more spiritual fruit will result from the testimonies people shared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<title>What Does Xenos Teach?</title>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/bible.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Xenos  Christian Fellowship encourages people of all beliefs and persuasions to  investigate what the Bible teaches. There is no official membership at Xenos or doctrinal tests of purity for anyone participating in our meetings.

However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central to the Christian faith  and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry, so teachers and leaders are educated in <a href="http://neoxenos.org/classes">Bible classes</a> where we affirm all the significant Christian "statements of faith," such as the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the other classical Christian statements of faith. The following is a summary of our core biblical teachings, but feel free to <a href="http://neoxenos.org/about/contact">contact us</a> with any questions.
<h4>The Bible</h4>
The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books that constitute the Bible  are entirely reliable and truthful, and stand as the central authority over our  lives, our faith, and the direction of our church. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).  We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such as the "Chicago  Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."
<h4>The Trinity</h4>
Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to these  persons as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is both self-existent  and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26)
<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and (since his incarnation) fully human. He  lived a sinless life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on  the third day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. (Jn.  1:1,14; Heb. 4:15; 1 Cor. 15:20; Lk. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the only provision  that God has given for people to be reconciled to Him. Christ is also the model  for the Christian life.

<!--break-->

<img src="/files/pictures/old/KeithCT_truefaith.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" width="191" height="125" align="right" />
<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith in  Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming our  salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life that is  pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also endows each  believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church. (John 14:16;  Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12)
<h4>Salvation</h4>
Salvation is reconciliation with God. God offers us salvation by His grace alone  and we receive it as a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus  Christ. This right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. (Eph.  2:8,9; Gal. 2:16; Jn. 1:12) God freely offers salvation to all people, and our  salvation is secure.
<h4>Humanity</h4>
Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique among all  of God’s creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, we have turned  against God, and this has resulted in spiritual death for all humankind.  Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need which can only be  satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. Without this reconciliation,  all people stand under God’s righteous judgment. Humanity, although fallen,  maintains the image of God and is, therefore, still dignified and unique. God  continues to love us and initiate toward us, even though we are hostile to Him.  Believers in Jesus Christ receive a new nature that becomes the foundation for a  process of transformation. (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<h4>The Church</h4>
The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving faith in  Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but people. God wants all  Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate context. This  context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature of our witness for  Christ. The church is God’s chosen instrument through which the message of  salvation is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the  church. We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the  gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26;  Matthew 28:19)
<h4>Satan</h4>
Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God’s followers. Satan  actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality of Christians.  We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the reality of personal,  spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat and judgment when Christ  returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20)
<h4>The Afterlife</h4>
At the final judgment, God will determine those who will receive eternal life  and those who will live in eternal judgment. Therefore, there is an urgency to  the message of the gospel because eternal issues are at stake. (Matthew 25:46; 2  Thessalonians 1:5-10)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://neoxenos.info/repo/uploads/reponet/ImageLib/bible.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Xenos  Christian Fellowship encourages people of all beliefs and persuasions to  investigate what the Bible teaches. There is no official membership at Xenos or doctrinal tests of purity for anyone participating in our meetings.

However, we consider a number of biblical doctrines to be central to the Christian faith  and vital to the integrity of all aspects of our ministry, so teachers and leaders are educated in <a href="http://neoxenos.org/classes">Bible classes</a> where we affirm all the significant Christian "statements of faith," such as the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed and the other classical Christian statements of faith. The following is a summary of our core biblical teachings, but feel free to <a href="http://neoxenos.org/about/contact">contact us</a> with any questions.
<h4>The Bible</h4>
The Bible is the inspired word of God. The 66 books that constitute the Bible  are entirely reliable and truthful, and stand as the central authority over our  lives, our faith, and the direction of our church. (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21).  We are committed to standard formulations of biblical inspiration such as the "Chicago  Statement on Biblical Inerrancy."
<h4>The Trinity</h4>
Three persons eternally share the Divine Nature. The Bible refers to these  persons as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is both self-existent  and personal. (John 14:10, 26; 15:26)
<h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
Jesus Christ, the Son, is fully God and (since his incarnation) fully human. He  lived a sinless life, died for the sins of humankind, was resurrected bodily on  the third day, ascended into heaven and is coming again as King and Judge. (Jn.  1:1,14; Heb. 4:15; 1 Cor. 15:20; Lk. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the only provision  that God has given for people to be reconciled to Him. Christ is also the model  for the Christian life.

<h4>Holy Spirit</h4>
The Holy Spirit is God. He indwells us at the moment we place our faith in  Christ. He empowers us to live an effective Christian life by affirming our  salvation, encouraging us and giving us the strength to live a life that is  pleasing to God and personally fulfilling. The Holy Spirit also endows each  believer with a unique spiritual ability to serve the church. (John 14:16;  Ephesians 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 12)
<h4>Salvation</h4>
Salvation is reconciliation with God. God offers us salvation by His grace alone  and we receive it as a gift through personal faith in the finished work of Jesus  Christ. This right standing before God must be received and cannot be earned. (Eph.  2:8,9; Gal. 2:16; Jn. 1:12) God freely offers salvation to all people, and our  salvation is secure.
<h4>Humanity</h4>
Human beings are created in the image of God. As such, we are unique among all  of God’s creation. Through the abuse of our God-given free will, we have turned  against God, and this has resulted in spiritual death for all humankind.  Humanity lives in a state of alienation and profound need which can only be  satisfied by reconciliation with God through Christ. Without this reconciliation,  all people stand under God’s righteous judgment. Humanity, although fallen,  maintains the image of God and is, therefore, still dignified and unique. God  continues to love us and initiate toward us, even though we are hostile to Him.  Believers in Jesus Christ receive a new nature that becomes the foundation for a  process of transformation. (John 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<h4>The Church</h4>
The church is composed of all those throughout history who place saving faith in  Jesus Christ. The church is not an institution, but people. God wants all  Christians to live out their spiritual lives in a corporate context. This  context of Christian love relationships is a crucial feature of our witness for  Christ. The church is God’s chosen instrument through which the message of  salvation is spread to all people. This mission is the central purpose for the  church. We are to carry the good news locally and worldwide and demonstrate the  gospel by relevant social action. (John 13:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 12:12-26;  Matthew 28:19)
<h4>Satan</h4>
Satan is the personal, spiritual adversary of God and God’s followers. Satan  actively opposes the work of the church and the spiritual vitality of Christians.  We therefore take seriously, but in a balanced way, the reality of personal,  spiritual opposition. Satan is doomed to final defeat and judgment when Christ  returns. (Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 20)
<h4>The Afterlife</h4>
At the final judgment, God will determine those who will receive eternal life  and those who will live in eternal judgment. Therefore, there is an urgency to  the message of the gospel because eternal issues are at stake. (Matthew 25:46; 2  Thessalonians 1:5-10)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Oops!</em> We Left Out the 'Organized Religion' Part!</h3>
[caption id="" align="alignright" width="80" caption="Tired of religion?We feel your pain!"]<img class="picture" src="http://www.neonets.org/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=12643&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="" width="80" height="80" />[/caption]

Sorry, we don't have a "church service," but we do get together in lots of  different Bible Studies. We just enjoy Christian fellowship without the formality of church membership, so it's open to anyone. It's where people check out the  Bible and ask questions without getting all uptight and religious about it. Jesus never setup a religion, so why should we?

<!--break-->

<em>And it's a good time!</em>

Who needs all the stuffing? The way he talked about it, Christianity isn't  a religion and never should be. It's more about relationships and lives that work right. It's more about fellowship, not "church". ((<em>A technical (but useful) note:</em> We don't like the word "church" because it's way too confusing. "Church" means something like a "church building" for most people, and that's definitely not what Xenos is all about -- and it's not a term the Bible uses either. "Gathering" or "meeting" is the word used in the Bible, not "church". See <em>"ekklesia</em>" in your Bible study tools.))

We are simply sharing the freedom that comes from knowing about the love Jesus gives us.

We get together for our Central Teaching (CT) every Saturday at 6:00 PM as guests of  <a href="http://ww.riverwoodchapel.org">Riverwood Chapel</a> in Kent, Ohio. It's a casual and friendly atmosphere, as people eat pizza and hang out. We try to get away from the formalities or traditions which too often get in the way of the  timeless message of Jesus Christ. At our Central Teachings, the ever-present  Snack Bar is a necessity.
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/pictures/welcome/ct-crowd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What's a Central Teaching Look Like?</h3>
People start arriving at CT around 5:30 pm, hang out, eat pizza, drink coffee, and start gabbing!  Sometimes it requires effort to get people in their  seated so the Bible study can begin at 6 pm -- but we usually get started on time. Visitors often remark how surprised they are to discover the relevance and usefulness of the Bible. We engage topics  such as personal growth and our relationships in marriage and family and friends. But we're very interested in the Bible's insights about current events, and we dialog with contemporary world views.

<a href="http://central.neoxenos.org">The teachings</a> cover a broad audience  with diverse backgrounds: from those without much traditional church experience to a wide array of spiritual or religious orientations, including mature Christians. Everyone benefits by learning God's Word at CT.

<!--break-->

After about 45 or 50 minutes the teacher is finished, and then an open-floor  discussion begins. The issues or scriptures studied usually raise questions. These open discussion  can be of great interest for visitors because other people may raise something of common interest. It's a great opportunity to simply observe and see how easy it is to share and talk in this group.

<img src="/files/pictures/welcome/fiddlers.jpg" alt="" hspace="10" align="left" />Then  we pray and bring burdens to God or simply share some thoughts with God. Anyone can pray. It turns the meeting into a real <em>Koinonia</em> (the biblical word for "fellowship").

Then it's time to hang out and talk or whatever else comes up. Often people make plans to go out and "paint the town red!" <em>Koinonia</em> builds an authentic sense of community.
<h3>What About My Kids?</h3>
<a href="/ministries/oasis">OASIS</a> offers childcare and classes for all ages during the central teaching, while other <a href="/ministries/students" target="_self">student groups </a>carry on their own meetings.
<h3>Why“Central Teaching?”</h3>
Our various <a href="/meetings/homes">home groups</a> come together at this meeting for more in-depth teachings and the animated fellowship a larger meeting offers. Although home groups grow and split, this meeting maintains a continuity of fellowship for everyone. It's also the best place to bring friends or family to investigate the Bible.
<h3>Who Teaches?</h3>
Visit our <a href="/meetings/central">CT podcast site</a> to  listen to Keith McCallum and guest speakers, or visit our <a href="http://neozine.org">online magazine</a> to read about our recent biblical interests.
<h3>How Do I Get There?</h3>
We meet at Riverwood Community Chapel's facility on Saturdays at 6:00. <a href="/meetings/times">See  our directions page</a> for a map and street directions.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We now have two home churches now meeting in the Cuyahoga Falls area attended mostly by young adults from the college and early-career age groups.
<h3>The Cuyahoga Falls Bible Study</h3>
<strong><span style="font-size: xx-small"> </span></strong>
<p align="center"><img src="http://neoxenos.org/files/pictures/old/KSU_alex_sarah_nicole.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></p>
<p align="left">The Cuyahoga Falls Bible Study is a church planting movement geared                 towards those in college, post-college and/or careers.</p>
<p align="left">Each week we meet in a casual atmosphere to investigate what the bible has to say. We engage in relevant discussions on                 what we hear and how it can make an impact on our lives today, even                 when it smacks against the popular ethos.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like more information on what our                       campus bible study is all about, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> about The Falls Project.</p>

We also like to hang out and get to know other on a deeper level. Unlike a superficial clique, we build a supporting network of friends that truly care about one another and are there to share in the challenges of careers and college life.

Get directions and more information about our home church from the <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a> page.
<h3>The New Michalek Home Church</h3>
This group is from the KSU and Akron University areas, meeting every Tuesday evening. More information will be available soon.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xenos Christian Fellowship is a non-traditional, interdenominational church with mainstream <a href="/about/beliefs" target="_self">biblical doctrines</a>.  In <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home groups</a> we develop   Christian communities <a href="/ministries/leadership" target="_self">led by volunteers</a>.
<p align="center"><img src="http://neoxenos.org/files/pictures/old/MorscherBasement.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3>What Makes Xenos Tick?</h3>
<strong> </strong>Like other Christian Evangelical churches,             we celebrate the Bible's message of freedom and the hope this brings to all humanity through Jesus Christ. We also dump the confusing rituals and traditions wherever the Bible gives us this freedom. Jesus taught about spiritual life and relationships, not <em>religion</em>.

This is why <a href="/ministries">our ministries</a> provide a warm and non-threatening environment             where people can seek God, ask questions, and find out what the Bible actually says. Read about <a href="/about/beliefs">our beliefs</a> to see what's so exciting about this person named Jesus Christ. He was remarkably irreligious, and he was all about personal relationships. Jesus brings a newness to life, called spiritual life, and that's when things get really interesting!

The Bible records the amazing history of God's kind intentions for us. He reveals what it means to be a human with a design and purpose. s He created us like shows us how to build significant lives that impact our families, friends, and the people we meet, and God changes us from confused is this is called Christian maturity. results in <a href="/ministries/leadership">leadership opportunities</a>. (Read about the Bible's <a href="http://neozine.org/inside/2007/significance/">model of significance</a> in our NeoZine).
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<strong> </strong>Xenos began as a home church movement <a href="http://xenos.org">in Columbus</a>,               Ohio where it swelled into a fellowship of about 3,800 adult members               in more than 60 home churches!           At that time, people from Cleveland began asking for the same kind             of informal meeting atmosphere.           In 1994 a Xenos church was first planted in Cleveland, and in 2001 the first Northeast Ohio Xenos church was planted at <a href="/meetings/cbs">Kent State University</a>. Since then we have planted more <a href="/ministries/homegroups">home churches</a> with a thriving <a href="/meetings/homegroups">Central Teaching</a> where everyone comes together in a larger meeting. We maintain a friendly and close           relationship             with <a href="/resources#xenos-links">other           Xenos churches</a> in Ohio. Read about our <a href="/meetings/times">meeting times and places</a>.
<h3>What Does the Word "Xenos" Mean?</h3>
<em>Xenos</em> (pronounced <em>zee-noss</em>) is a Greek word meaning             a traveler or someone living outside their native land. When combined             with the Greek word             <em>philo</em>, it             also means friendliness toward strangers, which describes how we open our homes to             others. The name Xenos reminds us that while we’re only temporary             residents on earth, we need to show true love and concern for all             people, especially those we don’t know yet. Xenos Christian             Fellowship welcomes people as they are.
<h3>What Does "NeoXenos" Mean?</h3>
If you lived anywhere near Cleveland you would already know that everything around here begins with "neo", as in "northeastern Ohio". That's because Cleveland is not just Cleveland. It's really a composite of three major metropolitan areas: Cleveland, Akron and Canton (sometimes Youngstown is included, but we prefer to ignore that). Northeast Ohio is a huge "Metropolitan Statistical Area" (MSA) according to the Census Bureau, and we're all over that MSA!

<p style="text-align: left">And we also like to think "NeoXenos" is the "new and improved" <a href="http://xenos.org">Columbus Xenos</a> where we first learned about some things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Christ commissioned the church to make disciples of all nations. At <span class="wiki">NeoXenos</span> this commission is central to our mission and vision as a local church. Explore the World Mission pages to find out more about what God is doing through missions teams in other nations and what you can do to support these vital ministries.
<p style="padding-left: 30px">But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, “How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news. Romans 10:14-15</p>

It's a sacrifice of love Americans are loath to make, but working behind the scenes, quietly, patiently, steadily, the passions of NeoXenos leaders and volunteers have proven that we will not stand on the sidelines while billions suffer around the world! Some of our recent activities include:
<ul>
	<li>The <span class="wiki">monthly Prayer Breakfast, which includes fellowship, food, prayer, and a mini-teaching on this vital area of interest.</span></li>
	<li>For several years now we've been receiving training on missions, its work and strategies at <a href="http://www.perspectives-neo.org/">World Perspectives classes</a> sponsored by the U. S. Center for World Missions.</li>
	<li>We are assembling a helpful collection of resources for small group or personal study on missions and poverty relief.</li>
	<li>The "What's-that-in-your-pocket?" fun is a monthly collection of spare change donated to missions work.</li>
</ul>
